## The inverse-square potential in quantum mechanics {#the-inverse-square-potential-in-quantum-mechanics}


### Intro {#intro}

The inverse-square potential in quantum mechanics is connected to phenomena like electron capture by neutral polar molecules, the Efimov effect in a system of three identical bosons, the transition between asymptotically-free and conformal phases in QCD-like theories as a function of the ratio of the number of quark flavors to colors, and the AdS/CFT correspondence. The attractive \\[ 1/x^2 \\] potential is interesting because it naturally calls upon the framework of the [Renormalization Group]({{< relref "renormalization_group.md" >}}). This approach will be seen to mirror the modern treatment of quantum effective field theories whereby one demans that long-distance observables remain insensitive to the adjustment of fine details at short distances.


### Pure Inverse-Square Potential {#pure-inverse-square-potential}

Consider the potential
\\[
V(x) = \begin{cases}
\infty & \text{if } x \leq 0 \\\\
\frac{\alpha}{x^2} & \text{if } x > 0
\end{cases}
\\]
for \\[ -1/4 < \alpha < 0\\]. Work in units with \\[ \hbar = 1\\] so energy is the reciprocal of time, \\[ \hbar^2/2m = 1 \\] so that energy is also the reciprocal of length-squared. Thus time and length-squared have equivalent dimensions. \\[\alpha\\] is dimensionless.
