## Peano Axioms {#peano-axioms}

-   `Peano Axiom 1`: 1 is a natural number.
-   `Peano Axiom 2`: Every natural number `n` has a unique successor `S(n)`, which is also a natural number.
-   `Peano Axiom 3`: 1 is not the successor of any natural number.
-   `Peano Axiom 4`: If `m` and `n` are natural numbers and \\(m \neq n\\), then \\(S(m)\neq S(n)\\).
