      <description>Endpoint Detection and Response Basics Generally, EDRs are applications installed on a target&amp;rsquo;s endpoints that collect data about the security of the environment - telemetry.&#xA;Components Agent: an application that controls and consumes data from sensor components, performs some basic threat analysis, and forwards the telemetry to the main server, which further analyzes events from all agents deployed in an environment. In response to activity deemed malicious, the agent may: log that malicious activity, sending an alert to a central logging system &amp;ndash; eg the EDR’s dashboard or a security incident and event management (SIEM) solution block the malicious operation’s execution by returning values indicating failure to the program that is performing the action deceive the attacker by returning to the caller invalid values, such as incorrect memory addresses or modified access masks, causing the offensive tooling to believe that the operation completed successfully even though subsequent operations will fail Telemetry: the raw data generated by a sensor component or the host.</description>
