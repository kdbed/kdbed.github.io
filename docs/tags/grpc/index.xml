      <description>gRPC gRPC (short for Google Remote Procedure Call) is a modern open-source framework developed by Google for creating high-performance, language-agnostic remote procedure call (RPC) systems. It enables communication and interaction between different applications or services running on different platforms and written in different programming languages.
On Linux, gRPC provides a mechanism for building distributed systems by allowing services to communicate with each other efficiently and securely over a network. It utilizes HTTP/2 protocol as its transport layer and supports different serialization formats like Protocol Buffers (protobuf) for efficient data exchange.</description>
