      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;birthday-attack&#34;&gt;Birthday Attack&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The birthday attack is named after the birthday paradox. The name is based on fact that in a room with 23 people or more, the odds are greater than 50% that two will share the same birthday. Many find this counterintuitive, and the birthday paradox illustrates why many peopleâ€™s instinct on probability (and risk) is wrong. You are not trying to match a specific birthday (such as yours); you are trying to match any birthday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
