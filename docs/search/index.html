        "content": "Abortion and the Supreme Court Roe V Wade Basic Conclusions - Roe Drawing on the First, Fourth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments, the Court said that the Constitution protects an individual’s “zones of privacy.” Citing earlier cases that ruled that contraception, marriage, and child rearing were activities included in these “zones of privacy,” the Court found that the zone was “broad enough to encompass a woman’s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.”\nBecause the Court determined that abortions were within a woman’s “zone of privacy,” it was therefore ruling that a woman had a fundamental right to the procedure. Although this right was fundamental, that did not mean that it could not be limited.\nThe Court said that as a fundamental right, any limitations on abortion must meet the standards of strict scrutiny. This meant that there must have been “compelling state interest” in regulating abortions, and the legislation must have been narrowly tailored to meet this “compelling” state interest. Constitution Center\nDobbs V Jackson Women\u0026rsquo;s Health Center Decision According to Alito, if a right isn’t explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, it must be “‘deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition’ and ‘implicit in the concept of ordered liberty’” to qualify for constitutional protection. He then spends many pages of his opinion arguing that the right to an abortion is not rooted in legal history or tradition. Vox\nObjections to the historical aspect of Alito\u0026rsquo;s argument Politico The Conversation\nArguments Dobbs is a religious decision But the other day, going over my charts before filing them away to prepare for the next term, a realization struck me. I had put Dobbs in the wrong place. Along with the decision about the praying football coach and the one requiring Maine to subsidize parochial school tuition, Dobbs belongs under “religion.”\nThat assertion invites pushback, I’m well aware. But step back from today’s artificial arguments about originalism and history, and consider the powerful social movement that led consecutive Republican presidents to appoint anti-abortion justices and that then drove the abortion issue through the Supreme Court’s open door.\nDoes anyone really think it was motivated by disapproval of the court’s reliance in Roe v. Wade on substantive due process, an interpretation of the 14th Amendment that accords meaning to the word “liberty” in the due process clause? Is there anyone who believes that if only the Constitution had included the word “abortion,” the anti-abortion movement would have failed to gain political traction?\n\u0026hellip;\nJustice Alito actually had the gall to write that “we do not pretend to know how our political system or society will respond to today’s decision.”\nJustice Alito took pains to present the majority’s conclusion as the product of pure legal reasoning engaged in by judges standing majestically above the fray of Americans’ “sharply conflicting views” on the “profound moral issue” of abortion, as he put it in the opinion’s first paragraph. And yet that very framing, the assumption that the moral gravity of abortion is singular and self-evident, gives away more than members of the majority, all five of whom were raised in the Catholic Church, may have intended.\nLinda Greenhouse, The New York Times, \u0026ldquo;Religious Doctrine, Not the Constitution, Drove the Dobbs Decision\u0026rdquo; No Consideration for Consequences When Alito’s draft surfaced, Foster told me, “I was struck by how little it considered the people who would be affected. The experience of someone who’s pregnant when they do not want to be and what happens to their life is absolutely not considered in that document.”\nie Diana Greene Foster, The Atlantic\nIn a 2007 decision, Gonzales v. Carhart, the Supreme Court upheld a ban on one specific, uncommon abortion procedure. In his majority opinion, Justice Anthony Kennedy ventured a guess about abortion’s effect on women’s lives: “While we find no reliable data to measure the phenomenon, it seems unexceptionable to conclude some women come to regret their choice to abort the infant life they once created and sustained,” he wrote. “Severe depression and loss of esteem can follow.” (ibid)\nIn time, 30 abortion providers—ones that had the latest gestational limit of any clinic within 150 miles, meaning that a person could not easily access an abortion if they were turned away—agreed to work with the researchers. They recruited nearly 1,000 women to be interviewed every six months for five years. The findings were voluminous, resulting in 50 publications and counting. They were also clear. Kennedy’s speculation was wrong: Women, as a general point, do not regret having an abortion at all. (ibid)\nResearchers found, among other things, that women who were denied abortions were more likely to end up living in poverty. They had worse credit scores and, even years later, were more likely to not have enough money for the basics, such as food and gas. They were more likely to be unemployed. They were more likely to go through bankruptcy or eviction. “The two groups were economically the same when they sought an abortion,” Foster told me. “One became poorer.” (ibid)\nIn addition, those denied a termination were more likely to be with a partner who abused them. They were more likely to end up as a single parent. They had more trouble bonding with their infants, were less likely to agree with the statement “I feel happy when my child laughs or smiles,” and were more likely to say they “feel trapped as a mother.” They experienced more anxiety and had lower self-esteem, though those effects faded in time. They were half as likely to be in a “very good” romantic relationship at two years. They were less likely to have “aspirational” life plans.\nThe Turnaway Study also showed that abortion is a choice that women often make in order to take care of their family. Most of the women seeking an abortion were already mothers. In the years after they terminated a pregnancy, their kids were better off; they were more likely to hit their developmental milestones and less likely to live in poverty. Moreover, many women who had an abortion went on to have more children. Those pregnancies were much more likely to be planned, and those kids had better outcomes too.\nThe interviews made clear that women, far from taking a casual view of abortion, took the decision seriously. Most reported using contraception when they got pregnant, and most of the people who sought an abortion after their state’s limit simply did not realize they were pregnant until it was too late. (Many women have irregular periods, do not experience morning sickness, and do not feel fetal movement until late in the second trimester.) The women gave nuanced, compelling reasons for wanting to end their pregnancies.\nAfterward, nearly all said that termination had been the right decision. At five years, only 14 percent felt any sadness about having an abortion; two in three ended up having no or very few emotions about it at all. “Relief” was the most common feeling, and an abiding one.\nFrom the May 2022 issue: The future of abortion in a post-Roe America\nThe policy impact of the Turnaway research has been significant, even though it was published during a period when states have been restricting abortion access. In 2018, the Iowa Supreme Court struck down a law requiring a 72-hour waiting period between when a person seeks and has an abortion, noting that “the vast majority of abortion patients do not regret the procedure, even years later, and instead feel relief and acceptance”—a Turnaway finding. That same finding was cited by members of Chile’s constitutional court as they allowed for the decriminalization of abortion in certain circumstances.\nYet the research has not swayed many people who advocate for abortion bans, believing that life begins at conception and that the law must prioritize the needs of the fetus. Other activists have argued that Turnaway is methodologically flawed; some women approached in the clinic waiting room declined to participate, and not all participating women completed all interviews. “The women who anticipate and experience the most negative reactions to abortion are the least likely to want to participate in interviews,” the activist David Reardon argued in a 2018 article in a Catholic Medical Association journal.\nStill, four dozen papers analyzing the Turnaway Study’s findings have been published in peer-reviewed journals; the research is “the gold standard,” Emily M. Johnston, an Urban Institute health-policy expert who wasn’t involved with the project, told me. In the trajectories of women who received an abortion and those who were denied one, “we can understand the impact of abortion on women’s lives,” Foster told me. “They don’t have to represent all women seeking abortion for the findings to be valid.” And her work has been buttressed by other surveys, showing that women fear the repercussions of unplanned pregnancies for good reason and do not tend to regret having a termination. “Among the women we spoke with, they did not regret either choice,” whether that was having an abortion or carrying to term, Johnston told me. “These women were thinking about their desires for themselves, but also were thinking very thoughtfully about what kind of life they could provide for a child.”\nThe Turnaway study, for Foster, underscored that nobody needs the government to decide whether they need an abortion. If and when America’s highest court overturns Roe, though, an estimated 34 million women of reproductive age will lose some or all access to the procedure in the state where they live. Some people will travel to an out-of-state clinic to terminate a pregnancy; some will get pills by mail to manage their abortions at home; some will “try and do things that are less safe,” as Foster put it. Many will carry to term: The Guttmacher Institute has estimated that there will be roughly 100,000 fewer legal abortions per year post-Roe. “The question now is who is able to circumvent the law, what that costs, and who suffers from these bans,” Foster told me. “The burden of this will be disproportionately put on people who are least able to support a pregnancy and to support a child.”\nEllen Gruber Garvey: I helped women get abortions in pre-Roe America\nFoster said that there is a lot we still do not know about how the end of Roe might alter the course of people’s lives—the topic of her new research. “In the Turnaway Study, people were too late to get an abortion, but they didn’t have to feel like the police were going to knock on their door,” she told me. “Now, if you’re able to find an abortion somewhere and you have a complication, do you get health care? Do you seek health care out if you’re having a miscarriage, or are you too scared? If you’re going to travel across state lines, can you tell your mother or your boss what you’re doing?”\nIn addition, she said that she was uncertain about the role that abortion funds—local, on-the-ground organizations that help people find, travel to, and pay for terminations—might play. “We really don’t know who is calling these hotlines,” she said. “When people call, what support do they need? What is enough, and who falls through the cracks?” She added that many people are unaware that such services exist, and might have trouble accessing them.\nPeople are resourceful when seeking a termination and resilient when denied an abortion, Foster told me. But looking into the post-Roe future, she predicted, “There’s going to be some widespread and scary consequences just from the fact that we’ve made this common health-care practice against the law.” Foster, to her dismay, is about to have a lot more research to do.

        "content": "Birthday Attack The birthday attack is named after the birthday paradox. The name is based on fact that in a room with 23 people or more, the odds are greater than 50% that two will share the same birthday. Many find this counterintuitive, and the birthday paradox illustrates why many people’s instinct on probability (and risk) is wrong. You are not trying to match a specific birthday (such as yours); you are trying to match any birthday.\nIf you are in a room full of 23 people, you have a 1 in 365 chance of sharing a birthday with each of the 22 other people in the room, for a total of 22/365 chances. If you fail to match, you leave the room and Joe has a 21/365 chance of sharing a birthday with the remaining people. If Joe fails to match, he leaves the room and Morgan has a 20/365 chance, and so on. If you add 22/365 + 21/365 + 20/365 + 19/365 … + 1/365, you pass 50% probability.\nThe birthday attack is used to create hash collisions. Just as matching your birthday is difficult, finding a specific input with a hash that collides with another input is difficult. However, just like matching any birthday is easier, finding any input that creates a colliding hash with any other input is easier due to the birthday attack.\nComptTIA Security+ ",

        "content": "DNS Zone Transfers DNS zone transfers using the AXFR protocol are the simplest mechanism to replicate DNS records across DNS servers. To avoid the need to edit information on multiple DNS servers, you can edit information on one server and use AXFR to copy information to other servers. However, if you do not protect your servers, malicious parties may use AXFR to get information about all your hosts.\nHow DNS Works DNS (Domain Name System) is like an Internet phonebook. It is responsible for resolving human-readable hostnames into machine-readable IP addresses. The system includes authoritative DNS servers that provide information and DNS caches that store that information temporarily for client lookups. A typical DNS query is very simple: a client provides a human-readable hostname and in response receives an IP address. However, the system assumes that the querying client knows the hostname.\nDNS servers host zones. A DNS zone is a portion of the domain name space that is served by a DNS server. For example, example.com with all its subdomains may be a zone. However, second.example.com may also be a separate zone.\nWhy DNS Zone Transfer is Needed DNS is a critical service. If a DNS server for a zone is not working and cached information has expired, the domain is inaccessible to all services (web, mail, and more). Therefore, each zone should have at least two DNS servers. For more critical zones, there may be even more.\nHowever, a zone may be large and may require frequent changes. If you manually edit zone data on each server separately, it takes a lot of time and there is a a lot of potential for a mistake. This is why DNS zone transfer is needed.\nYou can use different mechanisms for DNS zone transfer but the simplest one is AXFR (technically speaking, AXFR refers to the protocol used during a DNS zone transfer). It is a client-initiated request. Therefore, you can edit information on the primary DNS server and then use AXFR from the secondary DNS server to download the entire zone.\nHow to Initiate a DNS Zone Transfer Initiating an AXFR zone-transfer request from a secondary server is as simple as using the following dig commands, where zonetransfer.me is the domain that we want to initiate a zone transfer for. First, we need to get the list of DNS servers for the domain:\ndig +short ns zonetransfer.me Now, we can initiate an AXFR request to get a copy of the zone from the primary server:\ndig axfr zonetransfer.me @nsztm1.digi.ninja ; \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; DiG 9.16.24 \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; axfr zonetransfer.me @nsztm1.digi.ninja ;; global options: +cmd zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tSOA\tnsztm1.digi.ninja. robin.digi.ninja. 2019100801 172800 900 1209600 3600 zonetransfer.me.\t300\tIN\tHINFO\t\u0026#34;Casio fx-700G\u0026#34; \u0026#34;Windows XP\u0026#34; zonetransfer.me.\t301\tIN\tTXT\t\u0026#34;google-site-verification=tyP28J7JAUHA9fw2sHXMgcCC0I6XBmmoVi04VlMewxA\u0026#34; zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tMX\t0 ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM. zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tMX\t10 ALT1.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM. zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tMX\t10 ALT2.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM. zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tMX\t20 ASPMX2.GOOGLEMAIL.COM. zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tMX\t20 ASPMX3.GOOGLEMAIL.COM. zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tMX\t20 ASPMX4.GOOGLEMAIL.COM. zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tMX\t20 ASPMX5.GOOGLEMAIL.COM. zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tA\t5.196.105.14 zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tNS\tnsztm1.digi.ninja. zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tNS\tnsztm2.digi.ninja. _acme-challenge.zonetransfer.me. 301 IN\tTXT\t\u0026#34;6Oa05hbUJ9xSsvYy7pApQvwCUSSGgxvrbdizjePEsZI\u0026#34; _sip._tcp.zonetransfer.me. 14000 IN\tSRV\t0 0 5060 www.zonetransfer.me. 14.105.196.5.IN-ADDR.ARPA.zonetransfer.me. 7200\tIN PTR www.zonetransfer.me. asfdbauthdns.zonetransfer.me. 7900 IN\tAFSDB\t1 asfdbbox.zonetransfer.me. asfdbbox.zonetransfer.me. 7200\tIN\tA\t127.0.0.1 asfdbvolume.zonetransfer.me. 7800 IN\tAFSDB\t1 asfdbbox.zonetransfer.me. canberra-office.zonetransfer.me. 7200 IN A\t202.14.81.230 cmdexec.zonetransfer.me. 300\tIN\tTXT\t\u0026#34;; ls\u0026#34; contact.zonetransfer.me. 2592000 IN\tTXT\t\u0026#34;Remember to call or email Pippa on +44 123 4567890 or pippa@zonetransfer.me when making DNS changes\u0026#34; dc-office.zonetransfer.me. 7200\tIN\tA\t143.228.181.132 deadbeef.zonetransfer.me. 7201\tIN\tAAAA\tdead:beaf:: dr.zonetransfer.me.\t300\tIN\tLOC\t53 20 56.558 N 1 38 33.526 W 0.00m 1m 10000m 10m DZC.zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tTXT\t\u0026#34;AbCdEfG\u0026#34; email.zonetransfer.me.\t2222\tIN\tNAPTR\t1 1 \u0026#34;P\u0026#34; \u0026#34;E2U+email\u0026#34; \u0026#34;\u0026#34; email.zonetransfer.me.zonetransfer.me. email.zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tA\t74.125.206.26 Hello.zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tTXT\t\u0026#34;Hi to Josh and all his class\u0026#34; home.zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tA\t127.0.0.1 Info.zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tTXT\t\u0026#34;ZoneTransfer.me service provided by Robin Wood - robin@digi.ninja.

This means that unless some kind of protection is introduced, an attacker can get a list of all hosts for a domain, which gives them a lot of potential attack vectors.\nIn order to prevent this vulnerability from occurring, the DNS server should be configured to only allow zone transfers from trusted IP addresses. The following is an example of how this can be accomplished in the BIND DNS server.\n# /etc/named.conf acl trusted-nameservers { 192.168.0.10; //ns2 192.168.1.20; //ns3 }; zone zonetransfer.me { type master; file \u0026#34;zones/zonetransfer.me\u0026#34;; allow-transfer { trusted-nameservers; }; }; Additionally, it’s also recommended to use transaction signatures (TSIG) for zone transfers to prevent IP spoofing attempts.\nComptTIA Security+ Acunetix ",

        "content": "Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) Wiki Overview ISAKMP defines the procedures for authenticating a communicating peer, creation and management of Security Associations, key generation techniques and threat mitigation (e.g. denial of service and replay attacks). As a framework,[1] ISAKMP typically utilizes IKE for key exchange, although other methods have been implemented such as Kerberized Internet Negotiation of Keys. A Preliminary SA is formed using this protocol; later a fresh keying is done.\nISAKMP defines procedures and packet formats to establish, negotiate, modify and delete Security Associations. SAs contain all the information required for execution of various network security services, such as the IP layer services (such as header authentication and payload encapsulation), transport or application layer services or self-protection of negotiation traffic. ISAKMP defines payloads for exchanging key generation and authentication data. These formats provide a consistent framework for transferring key and authentication data which is independent of the key generation technique, encryption algorithm and authentication mechanism.\nISAKMP is distinct from key exchange protocols in order to cleanly separate the details of security association management (and key management) from the details of key exchange. There may be many different key exchange protocols, each with different security properties. However, a common framework is required for agreeing to the format of SA attributes and for negotiating, modifying and deleting SAs. ISAKMP serves as this common framework.\nISAKMP can be implemented over any transport protocol. All implementations must include send and receive capability for ISAKMP using UDP on port 500.\nFrom ComptTIA Security+ Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP), an element of Internet Key Exchange (IKE), is used to organize and manage the encryption keys that have been generated and exchanged by Oakley and SKEME. A security association is the agreed-on method of authentication and encryption used by two entities (a bit like a digital keyring). ISAKMPs use of security associations is what enables IPSec to support multiple simultaneous VPNs from each host. Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) provides confidentiality and integrity of packet contents. ESP provides encryption, limited authentication, and prevents replay attacks. Secure Key Exchange MEchanism (SKEME), an element of Internet Key Exchange (IKE), is a means to ex-change keys securely. Authentication Header (AH) provides assurances of message integrity and nonrepudiation. AH also provides authentication, access control, and prevents replay attacks.\n",

        "content": "Nietzsche and Stoicism Resolution of contradictions After describing the Stoics’ essential psychological characteristics, Nietzsche advances two obscure but critical remarks. First, he questions whether the Stoics’ attainment of their ethical ideal is significant on the grounds that the decision to adopt Stoic therapy is determined in advance by one’s character. Second, he rebukes the Stoics for underestimating the worth of pain and passion, and for the fatalistic acceptance of life that their therapy produces. Confusingly, however, Nietzsche elsewhere celebrates characteristics for which Stoicism is well known; for instance, self-sufficiency and its associated characteristics, such as hardness, independence, and self-mastery. Moreover, the Stoic’s fatalistic declaration, ‘I want nothing different!’, seems to express precisely the love of fate, or amor fati, that Nietzsche himself embraces.\nThe Stoics view nature as rationally ordered and teleological. Their world is pervaded by a ubiquitous casual order, called fate, which governs everything in accord with reason (Gould 1974, esp. 17–18; Long and Sedley 1987, 331, 340–343). Specifically human flourishing, or virtue, consists in perfecting humanity’s uniquely rational nature (Epictetus 6; Marcus VII.55). This requires assenting only to impressions in accordance with nature’s rational order, desiring only what is appropriate to this order, and acting only on rational desires. If achieved, such rational self-discipline allows joyful acceptance of fate (Epictetus 8; Marcus VIII.26). James A.
