        "content": "Abortion and the Supreme Court Roe V Wade Basic Conclusions - Roe Drawing on the First, Fourth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments, the Court said that the Constitution protects an individual’s “zones of privacy.” Citing earlier cases that ruled that contraception, marriage, and child rearing were activities included in these “zones of privacy,” the Court found that the zone was “broad enough to encompass a woman’s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.”\nBecause the Court determined that abortions were within a woman’s “zone of privacy,” it was therefore ruling that a woman had a fundamental right to the procedure. Although this right was fundamental, that did not mean that it could not be limited.\nThe Court said that as a fundamental right, any limitations on abortion must meet the standards of strict scrutiny. This meant that there must have been “compelling state interest” in regulating abortions, and the legislation must have been narrowly tailored to meet this “compelling” state interest. Constitution Center\nDobbs V Jackson Women\u0026rsquo;s Health Center Decision According to Alito, if a right isn’t explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, it must be “‘deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition’ and ‘implicit in the concept of ordered liberty’” to qualify for constitutional protection. He then spends many pages of his opinion arguing that the right to an abortion is not rooted in legal history or tradition. Vox\nObjections to the historical aspect of Alito\u0026rsquo;s argument Politico The Conversation\nArguments Dobbs is a religious decision But the other day, going over my charts before filing them away to prepare for the next term, a realization struck me. I had put Dobbs in the wrong place. Along with the decision about the praying football coach and the one requiring Maine to subsidize parochial school tuition, Dobbs belongs under “religion.”\nThat assertion invites pushback, I’m well aware. But step back from today’s artificial arguments about originalism and history, and consider the powerful social movement that led consecutive Republican presidents to appoint anti-abortion justices and that then drove the abortion issue through the Supreme Court’s open door.\nDoes anyone really think it was motivated by disapproval of the court’s reliance in Roe v. Wade on substantive due process, an interpretation of the 14th Amendment that accords meaning to the word “liberty” in the due process clause? Is there anyone who believes that if only the Constitution had included the word “abortion,” the anti-abortion movement would have failed to gain political traction?\n\u0026hellip;\nJustice Alito actually had the gall to write that “we do not pretend to know how our political system or society will respond to today’s decision.”\nJustice Alito took pains to present the majority’s conclusion as the product of pure legal reasoning engaged in by judges standing majestically above the fray of Americans’ “sharply conflicting views” on the “profound moral issue” of abortion, as he put it in the opinion’s first paragraph. And yet that very framing, the assumption that the moral gravity of abortion is singular and self-evident, gives away more than members of the majority, all five of whom were raised in the Catholic Church, may have intended.\nLinda Greenhouse, The New York Times, \u0026ldquo;Religious Doctrine, Not the Constitution, Drove the Dobbs Decision\u0026rdquo; No Consideration for Consequences When Alito’s draft surfaced, Foster told me, “I was struck by how little it considered the people who would be affected. The experience of someone who’s pregnant when they do not want to be and what happens to their life is absolutely not considered in that document.”\nie Diana Greene Foster, The Atlantic\nIn a 2007 decision, Gonzales v. Carhart, the Supreme Court upheld a ban on one specific, uncommon abortion procedure. In his majority opinion, Justice Anthony Kennedy ventured a guess about abortion’s effect on women’s lives: “While we find no reliable data to measure the phenomenon, it seems unexceptionable to conclude some women come to regret their choice to abort the infant life they once created and sustained,” he wrote. “Severe depression and loss of esteem can follow.” (ibid)\nIn time, 30 abortion providers—ones that had the latest gestational limit of any clinic within 150 miles, meaning that a person could not easily access an abortion if they were turned away—agreed to work with the researchers. They recruited nearly 1,000 women to be interviewed every six months for five years. The findings were voluminous, resulting in 50 publications and counting. They were also clear. Kennedy’s speculation was wrong: Women, as a general point, do not regret having an abortion at all. (ibid)\nResearchers found, among other things, that women who were denied abortions were more likely to end up living in poverty. They had worse credit scores and, even years later, were more likely to not have enough money for the basics, such as food and gas. They were more likely to be unemployed. They were more likely to go through bankruptcy or eviction. “The two groups were economically the same when they sought an abortion,” Foster told me. “One became poorer.” (ibid)\nIn addition, those denied a termination were more likely to be with a partner who abused them. They were more likely to end up as a single parent. They had more trouble bonding with their infants, were less likely to agree with the statement “I feel happy when my child laughs or smiles,” and were more likely to say they “feel trapped as a mother.” They experienced more anxiety and had lower self-esteem, though those effects faded in time. They were half as likely to be in a “very good” romantic relationship at two years. They were less likely to have “aspirational” life plans.\nThe Turnaway Study also showed that abortion is a choice that women often make in order to take care of their family. Most of the women seeking an abortion were already mothers. In the years after they terminated a pregnancy, their kids were better off; they were more likely to hit their developmental milestones and less likely to live in poverty. Moreover, many women who had an abortion went on to have more children. Those pregnancies were much more likely to be planned, and those kids had better outcomes too.\nThe interviews made clear that women, far from taking a casual view of abortion, took the decision seriously. Most reported using contraception when they got pregnant, and most of the people who sought an abortion after their state’s limit simply did not realize they were pregnant until it was too late. (Many women have irregular periods, do not experience morning sickness, and do not feel fetal movement until late in the second trimester.) The women gave nuanced, compelling reasons for wanting to end their pregnancies.\nAfterward, nearly all said that termination had been the right decision. At five years, only 14 percent felt any sadness about having an abortion; two in three ended up having no or very few emotions about it at all. “Relief” was the most common feeling, and an abiding one.\nFrom the May 2022 issue: The future of abortion in a post-Roe America\nThe policy impact of the Turnaway research has been significant, even though it was published during a period when states have been restricting abortion access. In 2018, the Iowa Supreme Court struck down a law requiring a 72-hour waiting period between when a person seeks and has an abortion, noting that “the vast majority of abortion patients do not regret the procedure, even years later, and instead feel relief and acceptance”—a Turnaway finding. That same finding was cited by members of Chile’s constitutional court as they allowed for the decriminalization of abortion in certain circumstances.\nYet the research has not swayed many people who advocate for abortion bans, believing that life begins at conception and that the law must prioritize the needs of the fetus. Other activists have argued that Turnaway is methodologically flawed; some women approached in the clinic waiting room declined to participate, and not all participating women completed all interviews. “The women who anticipate and experience the most negative reactions to abortion are the least likely to want to participate in interviews,” the activist David Reardon argued in a 2018 article in a Catholic Medical Association journal.\nStill, four dozen papers analyzing the Turnaway Study’s findings have been published in peer-reviewed journals; the research is “the gold standard,” Emily M. Johnston, an Urban Institute health-policy expert who wasn’t involved with the project, told me. In the trajectories of women who received an abortion and those who were denied one, “we can understand the impact of abortion on women’s lives,” Foster told me. “They don’t have to represent all women seeking abortion for the findings to be valid.” And her work has been buttressed by other surveys, showing that women fear the repercussions of unplanned pregnancies for good reason and do not tend to regret having a termination. “Among the women we spoke with, they did not regret either choice,” whether that was having an abortion or carrying to term, Johnston told me. “These women were thinking about their desires for themselves, but also were thinking very thoughtfully about what kind of life they could provide for a child.”\nThe Turnaway study, for Foster, underscored that nobody needs the government to decide whether they need an abortion. If and when America’s highest court overturns Roe, though, an estimated 34 million women of reproductive age will lose some or all access to the procedure in the state where they live. Some people will travel to an out-of-state clinic to terminate a pregnancy; some will get pills by mail to manage their abortions at home; some will “try and do things that are less safe,” as Foster put it. Many will carry to term: The Guttmacher Institute has estimated that there will be roughly 100,000 fewer legal abortions per year post-Roe. “The question now is who is able to circumvent the law, what that costs, and who suffers from these bans,” Foster told me. “The burden of this will be disproportionately put on people who are least able to support a pregnancy and to support a child.”\nEllen Gruber Garvey: I helped women get abortions in pre-Roe America\nFoster said that there is a lot we still do not know about how the end of Roe might alter the course of people’s lives—the topic of her new research. “In the Turnaway Study, people were too late to get an abortion, but they didn’t have to feel like the police were going to knock on their door,” she told me. “Now, if you’re able to find an abortion somewhere and you have a complication, do you get health care? Do you seek health care out if you’re having a miscarriage, or are you too scared? If you’re going to travel across state lines, can you tell your mother or your boss what you’re doing?”\nIn addition, she said that she was uncertain about the role that abortion funds—local, on-the-ground organizations that help people find, travel to, and pay for terminations—might play. “We really don’t know who is calling these hotlines,” she said. “When people call, what support do they need? What is enough, and who falls through the cracks?” She added that many people are unaware that such services exist, and might have trouble accessing them.\nPeople are resourceful when seeking a termination and resilient when denied an abortion, Foster told me. But looking into the post-Roe future, she predicted, “There’s going to be some widespread and scary consequences just from the fact that we’ve made this common health-care practice against the law.” Foster, to her dismay, is about to have a lot more research to do.

        "content": "Birthday Attack The birthday attack is named after the birthday paradox. The name is based on fact that in a room with 23 people or more, the odds are greater than 50% that two will share the same birthday. Many find this counterintuitive, and the birthday paradox illustrates why many people’s instinct on probability (and risk) is wrong. You are not trying to match a specific birthday (such as yours); you are trying to match any birthday.\nIf you are in a room full of 23 people, you have a 1 in 365 chance of sharing a birthday with each of the 22 other people in the room, for a total of 22/365 chances. If you fail to match, you leave the room and Joe has a 21/365 chance of sharing a birthday with the remaining people. If Joe fails to match, he leaves the room and Morgan has a 20/365 chance, and so on. If you add 22/365 + 21/365 + 20/365 + 19/365 … + 1/365, you pass 50% probability.\nThe birthday attack is used to create hash collisions. Just as matching your birthday is difficult, finding a specific input with a hash that collides with another input is difficult. However, just like matching any birthday is easier, finding any input that creates a colliding hash with any other input is easier due to the birthday attack.\nComptTIA Security+ ",

The conjecture asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1. It concerns sequences of integers in which each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if a term is even, the next term is one half of it. If a term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that these sequences always reach 1, no matter which positive integer is chosen to start the sequence. The conjecture has been shown to hold for all positive integers up to 2.95×10^20, but no general proof has been found.\nIn modular arithmetic notation, define the function f as follows:\n\\[ f(n) = \\begin{cases} \\dfrac{n}{2} \u0026amp; \\text{if } n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}, \\\\ 3n + 1 \u0026amp; \\text{if } n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}. \\end{cases} \\]\nNow form a sequence by performing this operation repeatedly, beginning with any positive integer, and taking the result at each step as the input at the next.\nIn notation:\n\\[ a_i = \\begin{cases} n \u0026amp; \\text{for } i = 0, \\\\ f(a_{i-1}) \u0026amp; \\text{for } i \u0026gt; 0. \\end{cases} \\]\nThe Collatz conjecture is: This process will eventually reach the number 1, regardless of which positive integer is chosen initially.\n",

However, in other countries, the governments may respond with repressive tactics. The question is do the protest precede the government response? On its face, the answer is yes because why would the government respond to silence?\nThe second condition of causality is correlation. As we explored above, correlation is a connection between two variables. Correlation is a prerequisite to establishing a causal relationship because if two variables do not move together, then it is difficult to suggest that one influences the other. Maintaining our example of public protest and government response, we often see that when people protest, the government pays attention. This is due to mainstream media coverage and social media activity of the protest. Since governments typically have responsibility for maintaining peace and security, anytime there are activities that may disrupt peace, the government will likely pay attention to what the media is covering and decide whether to respond.\nOur third condition of causality is mechanism. A causal mechanism is an explanation for how one variable influences the other. Explanations can vary from relatively straightforward to exhaustively complex. There is utility in employing both types of explanations to describe the influence of one variable on the next variable. The reason is it may be straightforward to some while the government responds to protesters. However, underlying this interaction, there may be other actors, decisions, and actions that may shape engagement between the government and protesters. For example, the Arab Spring starting in 2010 provides a contemporary example where people throughout countries in the Middle East publicly protested for changes in their political leadership and government systems. How did these protesters come together? Some researchers point to social media, like Facebook and Twitter, which helped people collectively organize their protesting efforts. Thus, we have a mechanism that shows how protest formed, and how that initiated reaction from governments.\nThe final condition of causality is non-spuriousness. Non-spuriousness means that another variable is not having an influence. With our example of protest and government response, we must be careful to consider that other factors may influence this relationship. What else could influence a government\u0026rsquo;s response to a protest within its country? A government may be hesitant to respond with lethal force if it knows it\u0026rsquo;s being observed by an international media. An international media outlet serves as a third-party observer to the activities within a country. As the media records through video and first-hand accounts, they can begin to share that information with the rest of the world. A government that uses lethal weapons on people who are peacefully protesting could result in an outcry from the international community. Thus, are protests the only thing that is influencing the government\u0026rsquo;s response? Or is there a spurious factor, such as the international media outlet, that having the government question how it should respond?\nAs you can see, from a running example of public protest and government action, establishing a causal relationship between two variables is difficult. The difficulty doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean we don\u0026rsquo;t work through these four conditions, both using reason and evidence, rather it represents a rigorous way to determine a causal relationship.\nfrom libretexts\n",

It\u0026rsquo;s composed of a hierarchical structure that is divided into several zones, starting with the top-level root zone.\nEach domain can use different types of DNS records. Some of the most common types of DNS records include:\nNS: Nameserver records contain the name of the authoritative servers hosting the DNS records for a domain. A: Also known as a host record, the \u0026ldquo;a record\u0026rdquo; contains the IPv4 address of a hostname AAAA: Also known as a quad A host record, the \u0026ldquo;aaaa record\u0026rdquo; contains the IPv6 address of a hostname MX: Mail Exchange records contain the names of the servers responsible for handling email for the domain. A domain can contain multiple MX records. PTR: Pointer Records are used in reverse lookup zones and can find the records associated with an IP address. CNAME: Canonical Name Records are used to create aliases for other host records. TXT: Text records can contain any arbitrary data and be used for various purposes, such as domain ownership verification. We can use the host command to find IP addresses (default search for A records):\n1 host google.com google.com has address 172.217.4.206 google.com has IPv6 address 2607:f8b0:4009:81c::200e google.com mail is handled by 10 smtp.google.com.

        "content": "DNS Zone Transfers DNS zone transfers using the AXFR protocol are the simplest mechanism to replicate DNS records across DNS servers. To avoid the need to edit information on multiple DNS servers, you can edit information on one server and use AXFR to copy information to other servers. However, if you do not protect your servers, malicious parties may use AXFR to get information about all your hosts.\nHow DNS Works DNS (Domain Name System) is like an Internet phonebook. It is responsible for resolving human-readable hostnames into machine-readable IP addresses. The system includes authoritative DNS servers that provide information and DNS caches that store that information temporarily for client lookups. A typical DNS query is very simple: a client provides a human-readable hostname and in response receives an IP address. However, the system assumes that the querying client knows the hostname.\nDNS servers host zones. A DNS zone is a portion of the domain name space that is served by a DNS server. For example, example.com with all its subdomains may be a zone. However, second.example.com may also be a separate zone.\nWhy DNS Zone Transfer is Needed DNS is a critical service. If a DNS server for a zone is not working and cached information has expired, the domain is inaccessible to all services (web, mail, and more). Therefore, each zone should have at least two DNS servers. For more critical zones, there may be even more.\nHowever, a zone may be large and may require frequent changes. If you manually edit zone data on each server separately, it takes a lot of time and there is a a lot of potential for a mistake. This is why DNS zone transfer is needed.\nYou can use different mechanisms for DNS zone transfer but the simplest one is AXFR (technically speaking, AXFR refers to the protocol used during a DNS zone transfer). It is a client-initiated request. Therefore, you can edit information on the primary DNS server and then use AXFR from the secondary DNS server to download the entire zone.\nHow to Initiate a DNS Zone Transfer Initiating an AXFR zone-transfer request from a secondary server is as simple as using the following dig commands, where zonetransfer.me is the domain that we want to initiate a zone transfer for. First, we need to get the list of DNS servers for the domain:\ndig +short ns zonetransfer.me Now, we can initiate an AXFR request to get a copy of the zone from the primary server:\ndig axfr zonetransfer.me @nsztm1.digi.ninja ; \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; DiG 9.16.24 \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; axfr zonetransfer.me @nsztm1.digi.ninja ;; global options: +cmd zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tSOA\tnsztm1.digi.ninja. robin.digi.ninja. 2019100801 172800 900 1209600 3600 zonetransfer.me.\t300\tIN\tHINFO\t\u0026#34;Casio fx-700G\u0026#34; \u0026#34;Windows XP\u0026#34; zonetransfer.me.\t301\tIN\tTXT\t\u0026#34;google-site-verification=tyP28J7JAUHA9fw2sHXMgcCC0I6XBmmoVi04VlMewxA\u0026#34; zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tMX\t0 ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM. zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tMX\t10 ALT1.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM. zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tMX\t10 ALT2.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM. zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tMX\t20 ASPMX2.GOOGLEMAIL.COM. zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tMX\t20 ASPMX3.GOOGLEMAIL.COM. zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tMX\t20 ASPMX4.GOOGLEMAIL.COM. zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tMX\t20 ASPMX5.GOOGLEMAIL.COM. zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tA\t5.196.105.14 zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tNS\tnsztm1.digi.ninja. zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tNS\tnsztm2.digi.ninja. _acme-challenge.zonetransfer.me. 301 IN\tTXT\t\u0026#34;6Oa05hbUJ9xSsvYy7pApQvwCUSSGgxvrbdizjePEsZI\u0026#34; _sip._tcp.zonetransfer.me. 14000 IN\tSRV\t0 0 5060 www.zonetransfer.me. 14.105.196.5.IN-ADDR.ARPA.zonetransfer.me. 7200\tIN PTR www.zonetransfer.me. asfdbauthdns.zonetransfer.me. 7900 IN\tAFSDB\t1 asfdbbox.zonetransfer.me. asfdbbox.zonetransfer.me. 7200\tIN\tA\t127.0.0.1 asfdbvolume.zonetransfer.me. 7800 IN\tAFSDB\t1 asfdbbox.zonetransfer.me. canberra-office.zonetransfer.me. 7200 IN A\t202.14.81.230 cmdexec.zonetransfer.me. 300\tIN\tTXT\t\u0026#34;; ls\u0026#34; contact.zonetransfer.me. 2592000 IN\tTXT\t\u0026#34;Remember to call or email Pippa on +44 123 4567890 or pippa@zonetransfer.me when making DNS changes\u0026#34; dc-office.zonetransfer.me. 7200\tIN\tA\t143.228.181.132 deadbeef.zonetransfer.me. 7201\tIN\tAAAA\tdead:beaf:: dr.zonetransfer.me.\t300\tIN\tLOC\t53 20 56.558 N 1 38 33.526 W 0.00m 1m 10000m 10m DZC.zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tTXT\t\u0026#34;AbCdEfG\u0026#34; email.zonetransfer.me.\t2222\tIN\tNAPTR\t1 1 \u0026#34;P\u0026#34; \u0026#34;E2U+email\u0026#34; \u0026#34;\u0026#34; email.zonetransfer.me.zonetransfer.me. email.zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tA\t74.125.206.26 Hello.zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tTXT\t\u0026#34;Hi to Josh and all his class\u0026#34; home.zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tA\t127.0.0.1 Info.zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tTXT\t\u0026#34;ZoneTransfer.me service provided by Robin Wood - robin@digi.ninja.

In response to activity deemed malicious, the agent may: log that malicious activity, sending an alert to a central logging system \u0026ndash; eg the EDR’s dashboard or a security incident and event management (SIEM) solution block the malicious operation’s execution by returning values indicating failure to the program that is performing the action deceive the attacker by returning to the caller invalid values, such as incorrect memory addresses or modified access masks, causing the offensive tooling to believe that the operation completed successfully even though subsequent operations will fail Telemetry: the raw data generated by a sensor component or the host. Every action on the system generates some form of telemetry, and these become data points for the security tool\u0026rsquo;s alerting logic, eg based on environmental heuristics or static signature libraries Sensors: intercept data flowing through an internal process, extract information, and forward it to the central agent. The offensive side of things want to prevent, limit, or normalize the flow of telemetry collected by the sensor with the of reducing the number of datapoints that the product could use to create high-fidelity alerts or prevent our operation from executing. Essentially, trying to generate a false negative.\nSources Evading EDR - Matt Hand\n",

        "title": "Fileless Malware",
        "tags": ["endpointProtection","antivirus","malware",],
        "content": "What is Fileless Malware? Traditionally, antivirus and other endpoint security products have focused on files (executables) to detect and prevent malware. There are several advantages to this. Files can be hashed, queried in reputation services, examined by both static analysis and machine learning, and easily excluded for false detections.\nThis is a problem for hackers: if the malware’s signature is detected two days after release, the attacker’s ROI (return on investment) may be significantly less than expected, or even negligible.\nFileless malware is malicious code that does not require using an executable file on the endpoint’s file system besides those that are already there. It is typically injected into some running process and executes only in RAM. This makes it far more difficult for traditional antivirus software and other endpoint security products to detect or prevent because of the low footprint and the absence of files to scan. These often utilize system processes available and trusted by the OS. Examples include:\nVBScript JScript PowerShell Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Batch files Mshta and rundll32 (or other Windows signed files capable of running malicious code) Malware hidden within documents is also considered fileless. Although such data files are not allowed to run code, there are vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office and PDF readers that adversaries can exploit to obtain code execution. For example, an infected document could trigger a malicious PowerShell command. There are also a few built-in functionalities that allow code execution within documents, like macros and DDE attack.\nHow Does Fileless Malware work? The most common form of fileless malware in the wild is when a victim clicks on a spam link within an email or fraudulent website. That link or website then loads the Flash application and implements a relevant exploit in order to infect the user’s machine. Afterward, the malware uses shellcode in order to run a command that allows it to both download and execute the payload solely within memory.\nCharacteristics This type of malicious software makes use of programs that are already on the computer. Its behavior can’t be detected by heuristics scanners and it has no identifiable code or signature.\nAdditionally, fileless malware resides within the memory of the system.\nIn order to function, it takes advantage of the processes of the infected operating system. More advanced fileless malware can also be combined with other types of malware to facilitate complex cyberattacks. It can even circumvent both whitelisting and sandboxing under the right circumstances.\nStages of a Fileless Malware Attack Such attacks function in a fairly unique way:\nMalware gains access to the machine oftentimes with a phishing email or social engineering tactic, or perhaps compromised credentials\nThe program establishes persistance implementing a backdoor\ndata exfiltration Common Fileless Malware Techniques Memory resident malware By using the memory space of a real Windows file, attackers can load malicious code that lies dormant until activated. The fileless aspect is that the malware can’t be detected by standard file-scanning antivirus software.\nRootkits Because rootkits exist on the kernel rather than in a file, they have powerful abilities to avoid detection. They are 100% fileless, but fit into this category as it evolves.\nWindows Registry Malware Like in the example mentioned above, these attacks takes advantage of the Windows Registry database that stores low-level settings for various applications. The malware relies on code executed through a file, but this file is set to self-destruct after execution, allowing the malware to persist as fileless.\nFalse credentials As the name suggests, this type of attack involves using compromised credentials from a legitimate user (aka – stolen username and password). After the hacker has gained access to the system, they then implement shellcode in order to facilitate their attack on the machine.\nIn extreme cases, they may even place code within the registry in order to establish ongoing access to the computer.\nFileless ransomware For those who are unfamiliar with this type of malware, ransomware is a malicious program that hackers use in order to extort money from their victims. They often encrypt sensitive data and threaten to delete it unless a certain amount of money is paid, often via cryptocurrency.\nWhen this type of fileless attack occurs, hackers are able to carry out the attack without ever writing to the disk of the machine. This makes it difficult to discern until it’s too late.\nExploit kits Threat actors use a collection of tools known as exploit kits in order to take advantage of vulnerabilities on a victim’s computer. These attacks generally begin as a typical fileless malware attack would, meaning they often convince the user to click on a fraudulent link.\nOnce the program is able to infiltrate the machine, the exploit kit can scan the system to determine vulnerabilities to take advantage of and then come up with a specific set of exploits to deploy. Oftentimes, the malware will go undetected and gain extensive access to the system and data.\nThe problem One of the reasons fileless malware is so compelling is that security products cannot just block the system files or software that are utilized in these kinds of attack. For example, PowerShell: More importantly, from a defensive point of view, blocking it would be futile: There are many public sources explaining how to bypass the PowerShell execution policy, and other ways to use it that bypass the PowerShell.exe block. To name a few:\nRun PowerShell with dlls only, with a simple rundll32 command using PowerShdll Convert PowerShell scripts into other EXE files, with tools like PS2EXE Use malware that utilizes its own copy of PowerShell.exe or modifies the local PowerShell to avoid recognition of PowerShell by security products Embed a PowerShell script in the pixels of a PNG file and generate a one-liner to execute it using Invoke-PSImage Blocking MS Office Macros In an attempt to eliminate this attack vector, Microsoft added an option to disable macros as a site setting (starting in Office 2016). However, most environments still allow them, so security vendors have mainly tackled this in two ways:\nBlock macros across the board – this enforces the same restrictions being offered by Microsoft for organizations that can do without macros Extract the macro code for static analysis or reputation checks – this can work in some cases. However, the shortcoming of this approach is that such code is extremely difficult to classify and detect within a tolerable false positive rate, especially for never-seen-before malicious macros. In addition, very few repositories of benign and malicious code exist. Another option is looking for common functions typically found in attacks, but again these are variable and not widely-catalogued Server-Side Detection Some products use agent-side monitoring only and make the decision on the server or in the cloud. This approach has the same disadvantages as any detection that does not happen on the endpoint. Mainly, in order to work, it requires connectivity and prevention is impossible because the agent has to wait for the server to respond before acting.\nDetection Behavior, not identity The key is to look at the behavior of processes executing on the endpoint rather than inspecting the files on the machine. This is effective because, despite the large and increasing number of malware variants, they operate in very similar ways. The number of malware behaviors is considerably smaller than the number of ways a malicious file might look, making this approach suitable for prevention and detection.\nAlthough SentinelOne uses multiple engines, including static and behavioral AI, the behavioral approach is extremely good at detecting and preventing this type of attack because it is agnostic regarding the attack vector.\nThe effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated in examples like the WannaCry campaign, where SentinelOne was able to defend customers before the ransomware had been seen in the wild.\n",

Hashing is such that it can\u0026rsquo;t be directly reversed (hash \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; plaintext), but the plaintext can be guessed by hashing a large number of candidates and comparing the results. Password hashing is one-way and deterministic. This means that sites that store hashes never actually keep the password, but re-hashing at logon provides a reliable point of comparison.\nHashing a password - md5 hash, which always produces output of 32 chars:\n1 echo -n P@ssw0rd | md5sum 161ebd7d45089b3446ee4e0d86dbcf92 - If the data needs to be used in its original format (ie needs to not be one-way), encryption is used. Passwords are unique in lacking this requirement. Password hashes are predictable, however, so a unique salt of random characters can be added to the beginning. The salt and the hashed password both get stored for later comparison to input. Even if the database is dumped, this then forces the attacker to take a password list and perform hashing with each salt prepended. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t present much of a problem with MD5 or SHA-1, but if a hashing algorithm designed for passwords is used, eg bcrypt, the story is different.\nSource: troyhunt ",

The important point: the tool reads encrypted credential data and then uses system key material to decrypt it so the raw hashes/credentials become visible.\nNTDS.dit NTDS.dit is the main Active Directory database (an Extensible Storage Engine / ESE database).\nIt contains domain objects: users, groups, computer accounts — and importantly the credential hashes for domain accounts (e.g., NTLM hashes and other secret blobs stored with the user objects), plus other secret blobs used by AD.\nThe credential data inside NTDS.dit is not stored in plaintext; parts of it are encrypted or protected.\nSYSTEM (the SYSTEM registry hive) The SYSTEM hive (the offline file is typically C:\\Windows\\System32\\config\\SYSTEM) contains the machine’s BootKey (sometimes called the syskey) and other registry data.\nThat BootKey (plus other key material derived from the machine’s LSA/DPAPI keys) is used to decrypt certain secrets stored by the system and in NTDS.dit (and LSA secrets).

        "content": "Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) Wiki Overview ISAKMP defines the procedures for authenticating a communicating peer, creation and management of Security Associations, key generation techniques and threat mitigation (e.g. denial of service and replay attacks). As a framework,[1] ISAKMP typically utilizes IKE for key exchange, although other methods have been implemented such as Kerberized Internet Negotiation of Keys. A Preliminary SA is formed using this protocol; later a fresh keying is done.\nISAKMP defines procedures and packet formats to establish, negotiate, modify and delete Security Associations. SAs contain all the information required for execution of various network security services, such as the IP layer services (such as header authentication and payload encapsulation), transport or application layer services or self-protection of negotiation traffic. ISAKMP defines payloads for exchanging key generation and authentication data. These formats provide a consistent framework for transferring key and authentication data which is independent of the key generation technique, encryption algorithm and authentication mechanism.\nISAKMP is distinct from key exchange protocols in order to cleanly separate the details of security association management (and key management) from the details of key exchange. There may be many different key exchange protocols, each with different security properties. However, a common framework is required for agreeing to the format of SA attributes and for negotiating, modifying and deleting SAs. ISAKMP serves as this common framework.\nISAKMP can be implemented over any transport protocol. All implementations must include send and receive capability for ISAKMP using UDP on port 500.\nFrom ComptTIA Security+ Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP), an element of Internet Key Exchange (IKE), is used to organize and manage the encryption keys that have been generated and exchanged by Oakley and SKEME. A security association is the agreed-on method of authentication and encryption used by two entities (a bit like a digital keyring). ISAKMPs use of security associations is what enables IPSec to support multiple simultaneous VPNs from each host. Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) provides confidentiality and integrity of packet contents. ESP provides encryption, limited authentication, and prevents replay attacks. Secure Key Exchange MEchanism (SKEME), an element of Internet Key Exchange (IKE), is a means to ex-change keys securely. Authentication Header (AH) provides assurances of message integrity and nonrepudiation. AH also provides authentication, access control, and prevents replay attacks.\n",

The GOT is important for techniques such as the ret-to-libc attack Stack Canaries = tokens placed after a stack to detect a stack overflow. Stack canaries sit beside the stack in memory (where the program variables are stored), and if there is a stack overflow, then the canary will be corrupted. This allows the program to detect a buffer overflow and shut down. NX = NX is short for non-executable. If this is enabled, then memory segments can be either writable or executable, but not both. This stops potential attackers from injecting their own malicious code (called shellcode) into the program, because something in a writable segment cannot be executed. On the vulnerable binary, you may have noticed the extra line RWX that indicates that there are segments which can be read, written, and executed. wiki PIE = PIE stands for Position Independent Executable. This loads the program dependencies into random locations, so attacks that rely on memory layout are more difficult to conduct. redhat Resource for properties involved in checksec : siphos\nCyclic If we look at the files and permissions in the cyclic directory:\nYou will see that the flag file and intro2pwn3 are owned by the same user, and that the suid bit is set for intro2pwn3. This means that the program will keep its permissions when it executes.\nTaking a look at the c code:\n1 cat cyclic/test_cyclic.c #include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;stdlib.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;unistd.h\u0026gt; void print_flag() { printf(\u0026#34;Getting Flag:\\n\u0026#34;); fflush(stdout); char *cat_flag[3] = {\u0026#34;/bin/cat\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;flag.txt\u0026#34;, NULL}; execve(\u0026#34;/bin/cat\u0026#34;, cat_flag, NULL); exit(0); } void start(){ char name[24]; gets(name); } int main(){ printf(\u0026#34;I run as dizmas.\\n\u0026#34;); printf(\u0026#34;Who are you?: \u0026#34;); start(); } We see that although we (buzz) can run this program, the print_flag() function isn\u0026rsquo;t executed. This program is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, because it uses the gets() function, which does not check to see if the user input is actually in bounds. In our case, the name variable has 24 bytes allocated, so if we input more than 24 bytes, we can write to other parts of memory. An important part of the memory we can overwrite is the instruction pointer (IP), which is called the eip on 32-bit machines, and rip on 64-bit machines. The IP points to the next instruction to be executed, so if we redirect the eip in our binary to the print_flag() function, we can print the flag.\nCyclic To control the IP, the first thing we need do is to is overflow the stack with a pattern, so we can see where the IP is.

The attractive \\[ 1/x^2 \\] potential is interesting because it naturally calls upon the framework of the Renormalization Group.

As a result, for the past many years, entertainment (superhero movies) has been swallowing up art (literary novels and serious dramas). But now, Gioia observed, even the entertainment business is in crisis. Hollywood studios are laying off employees. The number of new scripted TV series is down. That’s because entertainment is being swallowed up by distraction (TikTok, Instagram). Gioia wrote: “The tech platforms aren’t like the Medici in Florence, or those other rich patrons of the arts. They don’t want to find the next Michelangelo or Mozart. They want to create a world of junkies — because they will be the dealers.” The culture of consumerism, of secularism, of hedonism has undermined those institutions and that important work.

A ticket is typically base64 encoded and can be used for multiple attacks.\nThe ticket-granting ticket is only used to get service tickets from the KDC. When requesting a TGT from the KDC, the user will authenticate with their credentials to the KDC and request a ticket. The server will validate the credentials, create a TGT and encrypt it using the krbtgt key. The encrypted TGT and a session key will be sent to the user.\nWhen the user needs to request a service ticket, they will send the TGT and the session key to the KDC, along with the service principal name (SPN) of the service they wish to access. The KDC will validate the TGT and session key. If they are correct, the KDC will grant the user a service ticket, which can be used to authenticate to the corresponding service.\nEnumeration and Attacks Kerbrute Enumeration - No domain access required Rubeus - Harvesting and Brute-forcing tickets Pass the Ticket (PtT) Attack - Access as a user to the domain required Kerberoasting - Access as any user required AS-REP Roasting - Access as any user required Golden Ticket - Full domain compromise (domain admin) required Silver Ticket - Service hash required Skeleton Key - Full domain compromise (domain admin) required\n",

Kerberos still has a handful of underlying vulnerabilities that can be used in a penetration test.\nTerms Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) - A ticket-granting ticket is an authentication ticket used to request service tickets from the TGS for specific resources from the domain. Key Distribution Center (KDC) - The Key Distribution Center is a service for issuing TGTs and service tickets; consists of the Authentication Service and the Ticket Granting Service. Authentication Service (AS) - The Authentication Service issues TGTs to be used by the TGS in the domain to request access to other machines and service tickets. Ticket Granting Service (TGS) - The Ticket Granting Service takes the TGT and returns a ticket to a machine on the domain. Service Principal Name (SPN) - A Service Principal Name is an identifier given to a service instance to associate a service instance with a domain service account. Windows requires that services have a domain service account which is why a service needs an SPN set. KDC Long Term Secret Key (KDC LT Key) - The KDC key is based on the KRBTGT service account. It is used to encrypt the TGT and sign the PAC. Client Long Term Secret Key (Client LT Key) - The client key is based on the computer or service account. It is used to check the encrypted timestamp and encrypt the session key. Service Long Term Secret Key (Service LT Key) - The service key is based on the service account. It is used to encrypt the service portion of the service ticket and sign the PAC. Session Key - Issued by the KDC when a TGT is issued. The user will provide the session key to the KDC along with the TGT when requesting a service ticket. Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC) - The PAC holds all of the user\u0026rsquo;s relevant information, it is sent along with the TGT to the KDC to be signed by the Target LT Key and the KDC LT Key in order to validate the user. Flow AS-REQ - 1.) The client requests an Authentication Ticket or Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT).\nAS-REP - 2.) The Key Distribution Center verifies the client and sends back an encrypted TGT.\nTGS-REQ - 3.) The client sends the encrypted TGT to the Ticket Granting Server (TGS) with the Service Principal Name (SPN) of the service the client wants to access.\nTGS-REP - 4.) The Key Distribution Center (KDC) verifies the TGT of the user and that the user has access to the service, then sends a valid session key for the service to the client.\nAP-REQ - 5.) The client requests the service and sends the valid session key to prove the user has access.\nAP-REP - 6.) The service grants access\n",

        "content": "Kerbrute Kerbrute is a popular enumeration tool used to brute-force and enumerate valid active-directory users by abusing the Kerberos pre-authentication. based on obtaining a TGT. For example, using kinit on a Linux system, we can obtain and cache a Kerberos TGT. We\u0026rsquo;ll need to provide a username and password to do this. If the credentials are valid, we\u0026rsquo;ll obtain a TGT. The advantage of this technique is that it only uses two UDP frames to determine whether the password is valid, as it sends only an AS-REQ and examines the response. By brute-forcing Kerberos pre-authentication, you do not trigger the account failed to log on event which can throw up red flags to blue teams. Kerberos Pre-Authentication Behavior Kerberos authentication starts with an AS-REQ (Authentication Service Request) sent to the Key Distribution Center (KDC), which is typically the domain controller.\nWhen a valid username is submitted:\nThe KDC responds with an error indicating that pre-authentication is required (error code: KRB5KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_REQUIRED / 0x19).\nWhen an invalid username is submitted:\nThe KDC responds with an error indicating that the principal (user) is unknown (error code: KRB5KDC_ERR_C_PRINCIPAL_UNKNOWN / 0x6).\nTool ropnop/kerbrute User Enumeration 1 ./kerbrute userenum --dc CONTROLLER.local -d CONTROLLER.local User.txt 1 .\\kerbrute_windows_amd64.exe passwordspray -d domain.com .\\usernames.txt \u0026#34;Password123!\u0026#34; ",

        "content": "Nietzsche and Stoicism Resolution of contradictions After describing the Stoics’ essential psychological characteristics, Nietzsche advances two obscure but critical remarks. First, he questions whether the Stoics’ attainment of their ethical ideal is significant on the grounds that the decision to adopt Stoic therapy is determined in advance by one’s character. Second, he rebukes the Stoics for underestimating the worth of pain and passion, and for the fatalistic acceptance of life that their therapy produces. Confusingly, however, Nietzsche elsewhere celebrates characteristics for which Stoicism is well known; for instance, self-sufficiency and its associated characteristics, such as hardness, independence, and self-mastery. Moreover, the Stoic’s fatalistic declaration, ‘I want nothing different!’, seems to express precisely the love of fate, or amor fati, that Nietzsche himself embraces.\nThe Stoics view nature as rationally ordered and teleological. Their world is pervaded by a ubiquitous casual order, called fate, which governs everything in accord with reason (Gould 1974, esp. 17–18; Long and Sedley 1987, 331, 340–343). Specifically human flourishing, or virtue, consists in perfecting humanity’s uniquely rational nature (Epictetus 6; Marcus VII.55). This requires assenting only to impressions in accordance with nature’s rational order, desiring only what is appropriate to this order, and acting only on rational desires. If achieved, such rational self-discipline allows joyful acceptance of fate (Epictetus 8; Marcus VIII.26). James A. Mollison (2019) Nietzsche contra stoicism: naturalism and value, suffering and amor fati, Inquiry, 62:1, 93-115, DOI: 10.1080/0020174X.2019.1527547\n",

        "content": "NTLM Authentication Process I enter my username and password on my local computer. My computer runs the password I typed through the standard hashing algorithm used by both client machines like mine and the domain controllers (DCs) that provide authentication and authorization services. That gives it my password hash, which it will use in Step 5. My machine sends the nearest DC a logon request, which includes my username. The DC sends back a random number, which is known as a logon challenge. My computer encrypts the logon challenge using the hash of my password and sends the result (response) back. (Now you know why NTLM is called a challenge-response authentication protocol.) To see whether I provided the correct password, the DC encrypts the logon challenge using the hash of the password that it has on record associated with the username that came in the logon request — which was created using the same hashing algorithm as my client machine is using. The DC compares the result it gets with the response my computer sent. Since both the DC and my client machine are using the same hashing algorithm and the same encryption process, if the results match, that proves I entered the correct password. In that case, I’m authenticated. Note that during this NTLM authentication process, neither my password or its hash ever got sent across the network. For further security, all of these communications are encrypted using a shared secret key, which is my computer’s domain password.\nNTLM Relay 🧩 Overview\nNTLM relay is an attack where you do not crack or know the victim’s password. Instead, you trick a Windows machine into authenticating to you, then you forward that authentication to another server and become that user there.\nThis works because NTLM is a challenge–response protocol that (if protections are weak) allows credentials to be forwarded intact.\n🖥 Components Victim workstation: Win10-Client. The machine whose authentication you want to steal/relay. Target server: FileServer01. The server you want to authenticate to using the victim’s identity. Attacker machine: Kali or similar. Running tools like Responder or ntlmrelayx.py. 🔧 Step 1 — Set the Trap (listen for inbound auth) The attacker prepares to capture NTLM authentication attempts. Responder listens for LLMNR/NBT-NS traffic and spoofs hostname responses. ntlmrelayx can relay captured credentials to a downstream target. Example: ntlmrelayx.py -t smb://FileServer01 --smb2support This configures ntlmrelayx to:\naccept NTLM authentication attempts, negotiate SMB2 (faster + more reliable), immediately forward whatever credentials are captured to the SMB service on FileServer01. 🎣 Step 2 — Trigger Authentication Windows machines routinely send credentials over the network when they think they are talking to a file server or internal service. Attackers exploit this behavior using coercion tools.\nCommon coercion examples: LLMNR/NBT-NS spoofing (via Responder) → convince the victim that your machine is the host it is trying to reach. PetitPotam (EFSRPC abuse) PrinterBug (MS-RPRN) DFSCoerce (Distributed File System abuse) Example PetitPotam coercion:\npython3 PetitPotam.py -d domain.local -u user -p pass attacker@victim This instructs victim to initiate an NTLM authentication handshake toward attacker. 🔁 Step 3 — Relay the Authentication When the victim authenticates to the attacker\u0026rsquo;s server:\nntlmrelayx captures the NTLM challenge/response values. It immediately forwards them to FileServer01. This works only if the target server accepts unsigned SMB traffic or lacks EPA/Channel Binding: SMB signing disabled? → relay successful. SMB signing required? → relay fails. If FileServer01 trusts the signing settings, the attacker now holds a full authenticated SMB session as the victim user. 🛠 Step 4 — Use the Relayed Session (Command Execution / Privilege Abuse) Once authenticated, ntlmrelayx automatically tries post-exploitation actions depending on the victim’s privileges. You may be able to:\nEnumerate shares Dump LSA secrets Extract SAM database Execute commands (via smbexec.py or psexec.py-style techniques) Add a new domain or local admin If the target is a domain controller:\nDump NTDS.dit Extract all domain password hashes Achieve full domain compromise All without knowing the victim’s password or cracking anything.\n🧨 Why This Works NTLM’s design allows the challenge–response hash to be forwarded unchanged unless defenses are enabled:\nSMB Signing prevents MITM → cannot tamper or relay. EPA (Extended Protection for Authentication) binds the authentication to the specific service/SPN. Channel Binding Tokens prevent HTTP → SMB relays. Most real-world relays succeed because: legacy systems have SMB signing disabled for performance, misconfigured servers don’t require EPA, printers and non-Windows appliances still rely on NTLM. 🛡 Defenses (Blue Team Notes) Require SMB signing everywhere. Enforce EPA on all IIS and LDAP endpoints. Disable NTLMv1 entirely. Restrict NTLM usage per-server with NTLM Audit policies. Prefer Kerberos over NTLM where possible. ",

To obtain the most accurate information, we\u0026rsquo;ll look for the primary domain controller (PDC), which is the one holding the PdcRoleOwner attribute.\nLooking to .NET, we have the namespace System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory, and specifically the Domain Class therein. A method of interest is the following:\n1 [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain]::GetCurrentDomain() which will provide the PdcRoleOwner property, among others. We can use ADSI directly in PowerShell to retrieve the DN.

        "content": "gRPC gRPC (short for Google Remote Procedure Call) is a modern open-source framework developed by Google for creating high-performance, language-agnostic remote procedure call (RPC) systems. It enables communication and interaction between different applications or services running on different platforms and written in different programming languages.\nOn Linux, gRPC provides a mechanism for building distributed systems by allowing services to communicate with each other efficiently and securely over a network. It utilizes HTTP/2 protocol as its transport layer and supports different serialization formats like Protocol Buffers (protobuf) for efficient data exchange.\nTo use gRPC on Linux, you typically follow these steps:\nDefine the interface: Start by defining the API using the Protocol Buffers language (protobuf). This involves creating a `.proto` file where you specify the service methods, message types, and their fields.\nGenerate code: Once you have the `.proto` file, you need to generate code in the target language you\u0026rsquo;re using. There are gRPC code generators available for various programming languages. These generators will generate client and server stubs, allowing you to implement the service methods.\nImplement the service: Write the server-side code that implements the service methods defined in the `.proto` file. This code will handle the actual logic and functionality of the service.\nBuild and run: Compile the generated code along with your implementation, and then run the server application. It will listen for incoming requests on a specified network port.\nCreate clients: Implement the client-side code to communicate with the server using the generated client stubs. Clients can make requests to the server, invoking the defined service methods.\nTest and deploy: Test your gRPC service to ensure it functions correctly. Once satisfied, you can deploy it to production or use it as part of a larger distributed system.\ngRPC simplifies the process of building scalable and efficient distributed systems by providing features like bi-directional streaming, flow control, authentication, and load balancing. It\u0026rsquo;s widely used in various domains, including microservices architectures, cloud-native applications, and inter-service communication in large-scale systems.\nKeep in mind that the specific implementation details may vary depending on the programming language you\u0026rsquo;re using to build your gRPC service. However, the fundamental concepts and workflow remain consistent across platforms and languages.\nUI akin to Postman : https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcui can act as middleware in order to test, eg, SQLi (SQL Injection)\nInterceptor https://dev.to/techschoolguru/use-grpc-interceptor-for-authorization-with-jwt-1c5h\ncurl https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl#installation\npython https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/using-grpc-in-python\nhttps://labs.detectify.com/2021/02/18/middleware-middleware-everywhere-and-lots-of-misconfigurations-to-fix/\n",

The symbolic link holds the value of the physical path on the file system, the real device. The kernel calls ObpParseSymbolicLink to resolve the symlink.\nA regular user is limited in the creation and deletion of symlinks in the object manager. She can\u0026rsquo;t create/delete new symlinks under most object directories, such as \\Driver or \\Global??.\nThe object manager namespace is organized in a heirarchy tree. Each level is an object of the type OBJECT_DIRECTORY. EG the \\Device object directory contains the named device objects created by drivers.\nNTFS Symbolic Links Most recent implementation, used to link one file to another in the filesystem: mklink command.\nAlso through API:\n1 2 3 4 5 BOOLEAN CreateSymbolicLinkA( LPCSTR lpSymlinkFileName, LPCSTR lpTargetFileName, DWORD dwFlags ); NTFS Mount Points/Directory Junctions Link directories with mount point/directory junctions.

The next part consists of, eg, creating an Object Manager symlink on a log file in that directory that would point to a file in a protected directory. If a privileged application performs write operations on a log file in a directory we control, it can perform that same operation on the file that the symlink points to. Let\u0026rsquo;s say we find a privileged app that tries to delete a file with NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM privs, then we can reparse the delete operation for any other file that we have access to.\nhttps://nixhacker.com/understanding-and-exploiting-symbolic-link-in-windows/ https://www.cyberark.com/resources/threat-research-blog/follow-the-link-exploiting-symbolic-links-with-ease\n",

        "content": "powershell - Classes Introduction PowerShell is an object-oriented language. When you run commands, see the output on your screen, those are objects.\nSkeleton of a class called student:\nclass student { } Classes have properties that look like parameters that are attributes that describe that class. The example below shows a class called student with two properties; FirstName and LastName.\nWhen you define a property, you should always define a type that sets a specific schema for what property values can hold. In the example below, both properties are defined as strings.\nStudent Class Class with two properties:\nclass student { [string]$FirstName [string]$LastName } After you define a class, create an object from it or instantiate an object. There are multiple ways to instantiate objects from classes; one common way is to use type accelerators such as [student] which represent the class, followed by a default method that comes with every class called new().\nUsing the type accelerator shortcut is the same as creating an object using the New-Object command.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve created an object from that class, then assign values to properties. The example below is assigning values of Tyler and Muir for the FirstName and LastName properties.\nclass student { [string]$FirstName [string]$LastName } $student1 = [student]::new() $student1.FirstName = \u0026#39;Tyler\u0026#39; $student1.LastName = \u0026#39;Muir\u0026#39; $student1 | Get-Member $student1 | Write-Output Notice that Get-Member returns four methods and two properties. The properties probably look familiar, but the methods sure don\u0026rsquo;t. PowerShell adds certain methods by default, but you can add your own methods or even modify the default methods.\nMethods Defining methods with a scriptblock\n[\u0026lt;output type\u0026gt;]\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;() { \u0026lt;code that runs when the method is executed\u0026gt; } Method parameters set set inside the parentheses ().\nreturn is mandatory PowerShell functions will return objects by simply placing the object anywhere in the function; if a method returns an object, you must use the return construct as shown below.\n[string]GetName() { return \u0026#39;foo\u0026#39; } References Taken from: ATA\n",

When you run a function in PowerShell, PowerShell creates an automatic array variable called $Args. This array contains all unnamed parameter values passed to that function.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll find another automatic variable called $PSBoundParameters which contains a hashtable of all bound parameters.

Observable quantities are self-adjoint linear operators on the state space.\nIn classical physics, the state of a system is given by a point in a phase space, or equivalently as the space of solutions of an equation of motion. Observable quantities are functions (of coordinates and momenta) on this space. The Hamiltonian determines how states evolve in time through Hamilton’s equations.\nQuantum mechanics has different foundations:\nStates: The state of a quantum mechanical system is given by a nonzero vector in a complex vector space \\(\\mathcal{H}\\) with Hermitian inner product \\(\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle \\). The state space is linear; a linear combination of states is also a state. The state space is a complex vector space. Dirac notation for vectors in the state space reads as follows: \\[ |\\psi\\rangle \\] Observables: The observables of a quantum mechanical system are given by self-adjoint linear operators on \\(\\mathcal{H}\\).

        "content": "Quotes and Notes 1 - Marx You would be wrong if you thought that I love books. I am a machine condemned to devour them in order to vomit them up in a new form, like manure on the soil of history.\n— Marx in a letter to his daughter Laura, 1868\n2 \u0026ldquo;Meet these two here,\u0026rdquo; the man said. \u0026ldquo;Ask them if they\u0026rsquo;ve got a Mississippi credit card.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, I know that one,\u0026rdquo; Ruthie explaimed cheerfully. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s four feet of garden hose to siphon gas, am I right?\u0026rdquo; She looked at Willie slyly, then turned to Liberty and showed her teeth.\nBreaking and Entering , Joy Williams, p17 3 \u0026ldquo;Something is profoundly wrong with the way we live today. For thirty years we have made a virtue out of the pursuit of material self-interest: indeed, this very pursuit now constitutes whatever remains of our sense of collective purpose. We know what things cost but have no idea what they are worth. We no longer ask of a judicial ruling or a legislative act: is it good? Is it fair? Is it just? Is it right? Will it help bring about a better society or a better world? These used to be the political questions, even if they invited no easy answers. We must learn once again to pose them.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why do we experience such difficulty even imagining a different sort of society? Why is it beyond us to conceive of a different set of arrangements to our common advantage? Are we doomed indefinitely to lurch between a dysfunctional \u0026lsquo;free market\u0026rsquo; and the much-advertised horrors of \u0026lsquo;socialism\u0026rsquo;?\nOur disability is discursive: we simply do not know how to talk about these things any more. For the last thirty years, when asking ourselves whether we support a policy, a proposal or an initiative, we have restricted ourselves to issues of profit and loss\u0026ndash;economic questions in the narrowest sense. But this is not an instinctive condition: it is an acquired taste.\u0026rdquo;\nIll Fares the Land - Tony Judt 4 \u0026ldquo;To see what is in front of one\u0026rsquo;s nose needs a constant struggle.\u0026rdquo;\nGeorge Orwell 5 \u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s that lazy he won\u0026rsquo;t get up off the ground sometimes when he stumbles.\u0026rdquo; - Dude Lester of Jeeter, Tobacco Road, Caldwell\n\u0026ldquo;Them two dirty holes in her face don\u0026rsquo;t do a man no good to look at.\u0026rdquo; Jester of Bessie\n6 \u0026ldquo;Eppur si muove\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; and yet it moves; supposedly muttered by Galileo in 1633; can mean that although someone who possesses true knowledge is forced to renounce it, it does not stop it from being true. The story can illustrate the exact opposite: a deeper symbolic truth can be illustrated by something untrue (true designation of Galileo\u0026rsquo;s subjective position even though it\u0026rsquo;s likely false); reality of fiction (Zizek)\n7 The premise of discursive materialism is to conceive language itself as a mode of production and to apply to it Marx\u0026rsquo;s logic of commodity fetishism.\n8 In a Hegelian way, the problem (ie reporting trauma) is here part of the solution: the very deficiencies of the traumatized subject\u0026rsquo;s report on the facts bear witness to the truthfulness of his report, since they signal that the reported content has contaminated the very form in which it is reported. - Zizek\n9 Chesterton: \u0026ldquo;Tolerance is the virtue of the man without convictions.\u0026rdquo;\nPaul Claudel: \u0026ldquo;Mais la tolérance? Il y a des maisons pour ça!\u0026rdquo;\n10 Plato in Statesman: divisions (of genus into species) should be made at the proper joints. Eg, it is a mistake to divide the genus of all human beings into Greeks and \u0026lsquo;barbarians\u0026rsquo; \u0026ndash; not a proper form becaause it does not designate a positively defined group (species), but merely all persons who are not Greek. The positivity of the term \u0026lsquo;barbarian\u0026rsquo; thus conceals the fact that it serves as the container for all those who do not fit the form \u0026lsquo;Greek\u0026rsquo;. Hegel\u0026rsquo;s (and Lacan\u0026rsquo;s) hypothesis is that this holds for all divisions of a genus into species: every genus, in order to be fully divided into species, has to include such a negative pseudo-species, a \u0026lsquo;part of no part\u0026rsquo; of the genus, all those who belong to the genus but are not covered by one of the species. This \u0026lsquo;contradiction\u0026rsquo; between a genus and its species, embodied in an excessive group whose consistency is purely negative, is what sets a dialectical process in motion.\n11 Trends inequality: postindustrial, information age in which semi-skilled workers are no longer in demand; consequent increase in value of women\u0026rsquo;s labor, dual income model in which peers are more likely to marry; thus affect marriage and divorce rates and family as \u0026lsquo;incubator\u0026rsquo;; increasing inequality of opportunity can lead to inequality of outcome\n12 One cannot really understand the scientific worldview unless one assumes that the intelligibility of the world, as described by the laws that science has uncovered, is itself part of the deepest explanation of why things are as they are. \u0026ndash; T.Nagel\n13 Gossip theory of cognitive revolution; able to gossip (maintain trust, etc) on 150 folks; more than that requires myth-making; relation between individual myth (eg Hero 1000 Faces) and societal myth (statemaking);\n14 The problem this raises, of course, is-how is this possible? How does one mix things that don\u0026rsquo;t appear to mix? What allows Marx to construct theories-for this is what I am claiming-that are at the same time scientific, critical, visionary, and revolutionary? For the tale of two cities presented above, this translates as-what allows Marx to discover communism inside capitalism, and how does what he finds constitute both a criticism of capitalism and the basis of a strategy to overturn it? At the core of every science is a search for relations, especially relations that are not immediately obvious, and in studying capitalism Marx uncovers relations between what is, what could be, what shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be, and what can be done about it all. He finds all this, first of all, because it is there, but what permits him to find it-while most students of capitalism only come up with the appearances (mislabeled as \u0026ldquo;facts\u0026rdquo;)-is his dialectical method. It is dialectics, and Marx\u0026rsquo;s dialectics in particular, that not only allows but requires him to knit together what most others consign to separate mental compartments. - Dance of the Dialectic, Ollman\n15 Four causes of potential crises: i) human pressures on Earth\u0026rsquo;s ecosystem and climate; ii) rising population; iii) extreme poverty; iv) cynicism, defeatism, outdated institutions\n16 Coal liquefaction is a process of converting coal into liquid hydrocarbons: liquid fuels and petrochemicals. This process is often known as \u0026ldquo;coal to X\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;carbon to X\u0026rdquo;, where X can be many different hydrocarbon-based products. However, the most common process chain is \u0026ldquo;coal to liquid fuels\u0026rdquo; (CTL). Coal liquefactions originally was developed at the beginning of the 20th century.[2] The best-known CTL process is Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FT), named after the inventors Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch from the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in the 1920s.[3] The FT synthesis is the basis for indirect coal liquefaction (ICL) technology. Friedrich Bergius, also a German chemist, invented direct coal liquefaction (DCL) as a way to convert lignite into synthetic oil in 1913. \u0026mdash;- 1908-1914 Haber+Bosch process of synthesizing nitrogen-based chemical fertilizers (atmospheric N_2 \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; N-based compounds)\n",

        "content": "Education spending and student learning outcomes DAVID EVANS|JANUARY 17, 2019 World Bank Blog Prior findings World Bank\u0026rsquo;s World Development Report 2004 showed little correlation between spending and access to school World Development Report 2018 shows a similarly weak correlation between spending and learning outcomes Vegas and Coffin, using a different econometric specification, do find a correlation between spending and learning outcomes up to US$8,000 per student annually. Does money matter? Yes. [section copied from source]\nHistorically, most primary and secondary education was financed by local property taxes, so richer areas had better funded schools. But between 1971 and 2010, more than two dozen states had to reduce inequality in spending due to judicial decisions. This led to changes in school spending that were not related to other variables like local commitment to education that normally make it hard to parse out the link between financing and education. Using the variation in spending coming from the first wave of reforms, \u0026ldquo;a 10% increase in per pupil spending each year for all 12 years of public school leads to 0.31 more completed years of education, about 7% higher wages, and a 3.2 percentage-point reduction in the annual incidence of adult poverty. They also find that the effects are more pronounced for children from low-income families\u0026rdquo;.\nA study of more recent school finance reforms finds that \u0026ldquo;a one-time $1,000 increase in per-pupil annual spending sustained for 10 years increased test scores by between 0.12 and 0.24 standard deviations\u0026rdquo;. Another study finds that in states with strong teacher unions, school districts tended to match increases in state funding, which \u0026ldquo;led to larger increases in student achievement\u0026rdquo;. Other work looks at the impact of these financing reforms on high school graduation rates: \u0026ldquo;Seven years after reform, the highest poverty quartile in a treated state experienced an 11.5 percent to 12.1 percent increase in per-pupil spending, and a 6.8 to 11.5 percentage point increase in graduation rates\u0026rdquo;.\nBeyond school finance reforms, the Great Recession (2007 to 2009 in the United States) provides an additional natural experiment. State tax revenues fell much more suddenly than local or national revenues, so states that relied more on state revenues had a disproportionate drop in financing. Researchers found that \u0026ldquo;a 10 percent school spending cut reduced test scores by about 7.8 percent of a standard deviation\u0026rdquo;. Another study finds comparable results: \u0026ldquo;a 10 percent increase in spending improves\u0026hellip;student test scores by 0.05 to 0.09 standard deviations.\u0026rdquo;\nIn sum, out of 13 multi-state studies, Jackson finds that 12 show a positive, statistically significant relationship between education spending and student outcomes. And remember: these aren\u0026rsquo;t just correlations. These are all studies that have tried to tease out the actual impact of spending on learning or attainment.\nSee Jackson\u0026rsquo;s review for discussion around dependency on how money is spent.\nThe Relationship Between School Funding and Student Outcomes aei : Adam Tyner , 8 Oct 2019 Visible Learning \u0026ndash; Hattie Visible Learning\nFurther References C Kirabo Jackson American Economic Journal Finance reforms Learning Policy Institute \u0026ndash; report Countries outperforming Us beatty\n",

        "content": "An analysis of the coherence \u0026ndash; or lack thereof \u0026ndash; of Trump\u0026rsquo;s policies and politics , along with general remarks on what he did while in office.\nChanges in American Policy Many Americans will remember President Donald Trump\u0026rsquo;s presidency as a four-yearlong storm of tweets, rallies and on-air rants that ended in a mob riot and historic second impeachment. But there was more to the Trump presidency than attention-hogging political drama and conflict; often unnoticed, Trump and his administration actually did succeed in changing some of the ways Washington works.\nObamacare \u0026ndash; accidentally bolstered Trump came into office vowing to repeal Obamacare and even took the law to court when that failed in Congress. But his most significant imprint on the Affordable Care Act was an accidental boost that happened when he stumbled into pouring billions of extra federal dollars into subsidizing Americans\u0026rsquo; coverage.\nHouse Republicans had tried for years to cut off subsidies that helped low-income Obamacare enrollees with the co-pays, co-insurance and deductibles that come with their health plans. In 2017, Trump finally did it through administrative means after the GOP effort to replace the law fell apart, and he immediately drew intense outcry from Democrats and policy experts who called the move sabotage.\nThe health exchanges didn\u0026rsquo;t collapse, as Trump had hoped. Instead, health plans and states quickly figured out a way to claw back the federal dollars they lost: they built the costs of the subsidies into premiums for Obamacare\u0026rsquo;s benchmark \u0026ldquo;silver\u0026rdquo; policies. This meant that premiums for these \u0026ldquo;silver\u0026rdquo; plans spiked and as a result, the premium subsidies the government had to pay for low-income enrollees vastly increased. The concept, known as \u0026ldquo;silver-loading,\u0026rdquo; (Brookings , Bloomberg) grew government subsidizing of the exchanges by upwards of $20 billion per year.\nWhile Trump\u0026rsquo;s moves made Obamacare plans increasingly unaffordable for the unsubsidized, Democrats quickly tamped down their criticisms since it accomplished their goal of significantly boosting funding for Obamacare. The incoming Biden administration isn\u0026rsquo;t likely to reverse course.\nStrategy \u0026ndash; refocused national security on great power competition Trump administration\u0026rsquo;s National Defense Strategy stands out as one of the most important defense policy shifts of the last generation, reorienting the American military to confront rising and increasingly aggressive powers Russia and China.\nThe move: The 2018 strategy rewired the Defense Department\u0026rsquo;s vast bureaucracy away from a focus on fighting insurgents and terrorists in the Middle East toward a long-term strategic competition with China and Russia. As a result, the military is changing how it trains personnel, which technologies it buys, and the geographic areas of the world where it prioritizes its forces.\nThe impact: Already it has led to a reordering of the Pentagon budget and new investments supported by a bipartisan majority in Congress, including billions of dollars to beef up the U.S. military presence in the Asia-Pacific.\nThe upshot: Despite differences in tone and rhetoric, this is a refocusing of the United States\u0026rsquo; military posture that is expected to continue in the Biden administration.\nCoronavirus \u0026ndash; no workplace guidance Arguably the most consequential decision Trump made involving American workers was something it chose not to do: It declined to implement a so-called \u0026rsquo;emergency temporary standard\u0026rsquo; when the coronavirus pandemic hit. Such a standard, issued when the Occupational Safety and Health Administration determines workers are in \u0026lsquo;grave danger,\u0026rsquo; would have established immediate and mandatory workplace safety rules employers must follow to protect employees from exposure.\nThe move: Despite pressure from Democrats, unions and worker advocates, OSHA refused to set rules for worker safety during the pandemic. Republicans defended the decision by saying the burden on companies struggling to stay afloat amid the recession would be too great. In the absence of a standard, employers have only had to comply with a mix of optional guidelines, able to pick and choose what precautions they take.\nThe impact: The agency\u0026rsquo;s backseat approach to workplace safety means Americans still face a dangerously unpredictable range of safety conditions when they show up to work. Though OSHA has cited some companies for coronavirus-related transgressions, many large corporations received meager fines even in cases where workers died from Covid-19. Democrats have attempted to include language mandating an emergency temporary standard in future rounds of pandemic aid, but their efforts have been unsuccessful.\nThe upshot: One of the first things a Biden administration will likely move to do is instruct OSHA to step up worker safety enforcement, including by enacting an emergency standard and ramping up penalties on violators. Biden\u0026rsquo;s campaign also pledged to double the number of OSHA investigators to enforce the law and existing standards.\nWhy Not - 2024 the guardian promised mass deportations that will ruin lives and sunder families threatened to dismantle ACA and appoint anti-vac conspiracy theorist Robert F Kennedy Jr to a position of authority on public health; pledged vast cuts to social security and medicare; promised persecution of dissidents and violent suppression of political enemies his vulgarity, corruption, pettiness, narcissism and bigotry have been rewarded, at our expense; once again, the nation will be plunged into chaos as his vanity, greed, incompetence and anger take precedence over the national interest; once again, a violently and grossly misogynist man has been elevated to a position of superlative power over a flawed but competent, hardworking woman Does America deserve Trump? In the years since he rose to power, one theory posits that he is merely the manifestation of the nation’s unexorcised demons – a vestige of the racism that allowed this country to build its economy off the backs of the enslaved, of the casual relationship to violence that allowed it to build its territory and its global hegemony through violent conquest and coercion, of the grubby love of money and shameless disregard for principle that have always motivated our rapacious economy. In this version of the story, Trump is not merely a morbid symptom, but something like America’s comeuppance, a punishment for our sins. Living under his rule takes on the grim appropriateness of one of those ironic punishments in the underworlds of classical mythology, or in the hell of Dante’s Inferno. It is a feature of this horror that those who suffer most under his rule are usually those who are least culpable for these trespasses. Because we never really atoned – not for slavery, not for empire, not for the slaughter and dispossession of Indigenous Americans or the wars on and exploitation of foreign countries – this is what we now must endure: a figure who brings these cruelties home and who mocks our self-flattering delusion that we ever were, ever could have been, anything else. The Atlantic - Frum a country where millions of our fellow citizens voted for a president who knowingly promotes hatred and division; who lies—blatantly, shamelessly—every time he appears in public; who plotted to overturn an election in 2020 and, had he not won, was planning to try again in 2024. the atlantic - Throughout the campaign, Trump told voters that President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and undocumented immigrants were responsible for inflation, and that he would fix the problem. His proposals were often incoherent and nonsensical. For example, Trump promised to both whip inflation and also institute enormous tariffs, a combination nearly all economists agree is impossible. The mass deportation that Trump has promised would also likely drive up prices, rather than soothing the economy. But in a country where roughly three-quarters of Americans feel that things are on the wrong track, a pledge to fix things was potent. People feel that they don\u0026rsquo;t have a meaningful say in how they\u0026rsquo;re governed; people feel that the moral fabric of community has been unraveling; no sense of belonging, pride, solidarity (bowling alone); grievances of working people who feel elites look down on them; deepening inequality; for decades, neoliberal market-friendly globalization project leaving stagnant wages and outsourced jobs; if you\u0026rsquo;re struggling, your failure is your fault; reversal of dem + repub, where the dems used to be the party of the working people \u0026ndash; dems emphasized market+meritocratic triumphalism; widening inequality + stalled mobility; If Trump were elected and decided to make Project 2025 a reality, his administration would take an existing piece of bureaucratic infrastructure, strip it of many of those who can check its power, and then wield that power to ideological ends and against their political enemies. And that prospect alarms me as much as the idea of putting a man who uncontrollably blurts out vulgarities in charge of our nukes. - Paul Krugman References From: Politico\n",

        "content": "Wildcare Certificates digicert\nWhat is a SSL Wildcard Certificate?\nA SSL/TLS Wildcard certificate is a single certificate with a wildcard character (*) in the domain name field. This allows the certificate to secure multiple sub domain names (hosts) pertaining to the same base domain.\nFor example, a wildcard certificate for *.(domainname).com, could be used for www.(domainname).com, mail.(domainname).com, store.(domainname).com, in addition to any additional sub domain name in the (domainname).com.\nWhen a client checks the sub domain name in this type of certificate, it uses a shell expansion procedure to see if it matches.\nWhat is the difference between a SAN certificate and a Wildcard certificate? A Subject Alternative Name (SAN) certificate is capable of supporting multiple domains and multiple host names with domains. SANS certificates are more flexible than Wildcard certificates since they are not limited to a single domain.\nCombining the functionality of both allows you secure a much broader set of domains along with the capability to use them on any number of sub-domains.\nNote: Only non-Wildcard names can be added as SAN.\nWhen should I request a SSL Wildcard Certificate?\nA SSL/TLS Wildcard certificate should be considered an option when looking to secure a number of sub domains, such as \u0026lsquo;secure.(domainname).com\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;www.(domainname).com\u0026rsquo;, and \u0026lsquo;mail.(domainname).com\u0026rsquo; with a single certificate.\nThe format of the common name entered for the SSL/TLS Wildcard Certificate will be \u0026lsquo;*.(domainname).com\u0026rsquo;.\nHow do I add SAN? SAN is an optional feature available during your Wildcard SSL/TLS purchase, you can add up to an additional 250 SANs to a single certificate.\nNote: It is imperative that software documentation is referenced to ensure that the server on which the certificate will be installed on supports wildcard certificates.\nDo SSL/TLS Wildcard Certificates work with all servers and browsers?\nSSL/TLS Wildcard certificates work with most servers. If unsure, check with your server vendor for further assistance.\nCan I share the IP address with all the sub domain names?\nYes. As the same certificate will be used to secure all the sub domain names associated with a domain name, an IP address can be shared amongst all of the sub domain names. SSL/TLS by nature of the protocol is IP based but in this case, where the same certificate will be used by all sub domain names, a Wildcard certificate can be configured for use with name-based virtual hosts instead of IP -based virtual hosts.\nUpdating licensing is not applicable.\nTLS/SSL Wildcard Certificates: Multiple Servers\nA TLS/SSL Wildcard certificate secures all the sub domain names associated with a domain name on one server. If multiple servers are involved, the certificate and it\u0026rsquo;s corresponding private key would need to be used on the other servers.\nPlease Note: The use of one certificate on more than one device can result in increased security risks to networks and that DigiCert expressly disclaims any liability for breaches of security that result from the distribution of a single private key across multiple devices.\n",

It ensures that your operating system and firmware are authentic and have not been tampered with. TPMs can be implemented as discrete chips, which are separate components on the motherboard, or as integrated solutions within the main processor.\nFor example, the Microsoft Pluton security processor is an integrated solution that embeds TPM functionality directly into the CPU. This integration reduces the attack surface by eliminating the communication path between the CPU and a separate security chip.\nSeveral Windows features leverage TPM to enhance security, including:\nWindows Hello uses the TPM to securely store biometric data (like fingerprints or facial recognition) and PINs, providing a secure and convenient way to sign into your device without using a password\nBitLocker uses the TPM to encrypt your hard drive, ensuring that the data remains secure even if your device is lost or stolen.

Notice that (usually on machine with GUI) wrong permissions of this file, can cause a login screen loop\u0026hellip; (took me hours to understand that).\nAs you mentioned there are 5 mechanisms:\nHost access: the server has host access list (if a network address exists in this list, the connection is permitted). the list is managed using xhost command. NOTE: this doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow more than a single connection simultaneously. I don\u0026rsquo;t know more about this method because I don\u0026rsquo;t really used it. but you can see man Xserver GRANTING ACCESS section :)\nMIT-magic-cookie-1: Generating 128bit of key (\u0026ldquo;cookie\u0026rdquo;), storing it in ~/.Xauthority (or where XAUTHORITY envvar points to). The client sends it to server plain! the server checks whether it has a copy of this \u0026ldquo;cookie\u0026rdquo; and if so, the connection is permitted. the key is generated by DMX.\nXDM-authorization-1: Again, there is a key stored in ~/.Xauthority. this key consists 2 parts- 56bit DES encryption key and 64bits of random data used as the authenticator. When you connect to the server the client generate 192bits of data: ctime combined with 48bits identifier (for tcp/ip: ip address+port, for local connections it\u0026rsquo;s the PID and 32 bit unique id). the DES key is used to encrypt the data and then it is sent to server. the server validate the user by decrypting it then validating the 64bits authenticator and additional data.\nsun-des-1: it uses asymmetric encryption, the server has a public key which he uses to decrypt incomming requests. it also uses the \u0026ldquo;host list\u0026rdquo;. This require some additional mechanisms in the network, I don\u0026rsquo;t have such network so again, I don\u0026rsquo;t understand this mechanism well.\nserver interpreted: It can be implemented in so many ways\u0026hellip; but in general, the client send 2 string to server. The second string is the user entry (such as username) and the first string is the entry type (such as localuser).\nNOTE: the 2nd, 3rd and 4th mechanisms store the keys inside ~/.Xauthority therefore anyone who has access to this file, can connect to the server pretending to be \u0026ldquo;you\u0026rdquo;.\nxauth command can parse Xauthority file and extract the interesting values.\n",

It is a proof system with a prover, a verifier, and a challenge that gives users the ability to publicly share a proof of knowledge or ownership without revealing the details of it.\nFirst appeared in this Zero Knowledge paper by Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali, and Charles Rackoff:\n“A zero-knowledge protocol is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that something is true, without revealing any information apart from the fact that this specific statement is true.”\nZero-knowledge proofs must satisfy three properties:\nCompleteness: if the statement is true, an honest verifier will be convinced by an honest prover. Soundness: if the statement is false, no dishonest prover can convince the honest verifier. The proof systems are truthful and do not allow cheating. Zero-Knowledge: if the statement is true, no verifier learns anything other than the fact that the statement is true Interactive zero-knowledge proofs require the prover and verifier to engage in a back-and-forth dialogue in order to complete the proof. Non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs are those in which the prover sends a single message to the verifier, who is then able to check the validity of the proof without any further communication from the prover.\nSimplest Analogy Where\u0026rsquo;s Waldo? You know where Waldo is in an image but your friend doesn\u0026rsquo;t. To prove you know the location without giving it away, you take a massive piece of paper to cover up the entire image, showing your friend the image of Waldo through a cutout. You can prove that you really know Waldo’s location, yet your friend will not gain knowledge of where Waldo is since the exact coordinates of Waldo relative to the image would still be unknown to him.\nLocked Safe You meet someone you do not know, yet she claims to also be a member of the group you are part of. How can you know if you can trust her? Luckily, your group has a locked safe, and only the members of your group know the secret combination code to gain access to the safe. So write a secret message and place it in the locked safe.\nThe verifier puts the secret code in a locked safe. The prover, who fulfills (grou-membership) requirements, knows the combination and opens the safe. Prover returns message to verifier Verifier trusts the prover based on proven knowledge of combination without revealing combination Basic mechanics of interactive zero-knowledge proof works.\nOpaque pricing You and a competitor want to know if you\u0026rsquo;re paying the same price for supplies without divulging the price.\nAssume there are only four possible prices.\nPlace four lockable boxes in a private, secure room, where each box corresponds to a possible price. You go into the room alone. You take the key to the box labelled by your price and destroy the keys to the other boxes. You leave the room Your competitor enters alone, puts a slip of paper with a check into the box corresponding to the price they\u0026rsquo;re paying, and slips of paper with X\u0026rsquo;s into the other boxes. They leave the room You return to the room and open the box with the key you kept. You find a slip of paper with an X and know you\u0026rsquo;re not paying the same price as your competitor You show the slip of paper to your competitor. You\u0026rsquo;ve determined if the price paid is the same without revealing the price.\nSource circularise\n",
