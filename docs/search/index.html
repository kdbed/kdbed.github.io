        "content": "Abortion and the Supreme Court Roe V Wade Basic Conclusions - Roe Drawing on the First, Fourth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments, the Court said that the Constitution protects an individual’s “zones of privacy.” Citing earlier cases that ruled that contraception, marriage, and child rearing were activities included in these “zones of privacy,” the Court found that the zone was “broad enough to encompass a woman’s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.”\nBecause the Court determined that abortions were within a woman’s “zone of privacy,” it was therefore ruling that a woman had a fundamental right to the procedure. Although this right was fundamental, that did not mean that it could not be limited.\nThe Court said that as a fundamental right, any limitations on abortion must meet the standards of strict scrutiny. This meant that there must have been “compelling state interest” in regulating abortions, and the legislation must have been narrowly tailored to meet this “compelling” state interest. Constitution Center\nDobbs V Jackson Women\u0026rsquo;s Health Center Decision According to Alito, if a right isn’t explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, it must be “‘deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition’ and ‘implicit in the concept of ordered liberty’” to qualify for constitutional protection. He then spends many pages of his opinion arguing that the right to an abortion is not rooted in legal history or tradition. Vox\nObjections to the historical aspect of Alito\u0026rsquo;s argument Politico The Conversation\nArguments Dobbs is a religious decision But the other day, going over my charts before filing them away to prepare for the next term, a realization struck me. I had put Dobbs in the wrong place. Along with the decision about the praying football coach and the one requiring Maine to subsidize parochial school tuition, Dobbs belongs under “religion.”\nThat assertion invites pushback, I’m well aware. But step back from today’s artificial arguments about originalism and history, and consider the powerful social movement that led consecutive Republican presidents to appoint anti-abortion justices and that then drove the abortion issue through the Supreme Court’s open door.\nDoes anyone really think it was motivated by disapproval of the court’s reliance in Roe v. Wade on substantive due process, an interpretation of the 14th Amendment that accords meaning to the word “liberty” in the due process clause? Is there anyone who believes that if only the Constitution had included the word “abortion,” the anti-abortion movement would have failed to gain political traction?\n\u0026hellip;\nJustice Alito actually had the gall to write that “we do not pretend to know how our political system or society will respond to today’s decision.”\nJustice Alito took pains to present the majority’s conclusion as the product of pure legal reasoning engaged in by judges standing majestically above the fray of Americans’ “sharply conflicting views” on the “profound moral issue” of abortion, as he put it in the opinion’s first paragraph. And yet that very framing, the assumption that the moral gravity of abortion is singular and self-evident, gives away more than members of the majority, all five of whom were raised in the Catholic Church, may have intended.\nLinda Greenhouse, The New York Times, \u0026ldquo;Religious Doctrine, Not the Constitution, Drove the Dobbs Decision\u0026rdquo; No Consideration for Consequences When Alito’s draft surfaced, Foster told me, “I was struck by how little it considered the people who would be affected. The experience of someone who’s pregnant when they do not want to be and what happens to their life is absolutely not considered in that document.”\nie Diana Greene Foster, The Atlantic\nIn a 2007 decision, Gonzales v. Carhart, the Supreme Court upheld a ban on one specific, uncommon abortion procedure. In his majority opinion, Justice Anthony Kennedy ventured a guess about abortion’s effect on women’s lives: “While we find no reliable data to measure the phenomenon, it seems unexceptionable to conclude some women come to regret their choice to abort the infant life they once created and sustained,” he wrote. “Severe depression and loss of esteem can follow.” (ibid)\nIn time, 30 abortion providers—ones that had the latest gestational limit of any clinic within 150 miles, meaning that a person could not easily access an abortion if they were turned away—agreed to work with the researchers. They recruited nearly 1,000 women to be interviewed every six months for five years. The findings were voluminous, resulting in 50 publications and counting. They were also clear. Kennedy’s speculation was wrong: Women, as a general point, do not regret having an abortion at all. (ibid)\nResearchers found, among other things, that women who were denied abortions were more likely to end up living in poverty. They had worse credit scores and, even years later, were more likely to not have enough money for the basics, such as food and gas. They were more likely to be unemployed. They were more likely to go through bankruptcy or eviction. “The two groups were economically the same when they sought an abortion,” Foster told me. “One became poorer.” (ibid)\nIn addition, those denied a termination were more likely to be with a partner who abused them. They were more likely to end up as a single parent. They had more trouble bonding with their infants, were less likely to agree with the statement “I feel happy when my child laughs or smiles,” and were more likely to say they “feel trapped as a mother.” They experienced more anxiety and had lower self-esteem, though those effects faded in time. They were half as likely to be in a “very good” romantic relationship at two years. They were less likely to have “aspirational” life plans.\nThe Turnaway Study also showed that abortion is a choice that women often make in order to take care of their family. Most of the women seeking an abortion were already mothers. In the years after they terminated a pregnancy, their kids were better off; they were more likely to hit their developmental milestones and less likely to live in poverty. Moreover, many women who had an abortion went on to have more children. Those pregnancies were much more likely to be planned, and those kids had better outcomes too.\nThe interviews made clear that women, far from taking a casual view of abortion, took the decision seriously. Most reported using contraception when they got pregnant, and most of the people who sought an abortion after their state’s limit simply did not realize they were pregnant until it was too late. (Many women have irregular periods, do not experience morning sickness, and do not feel fetal movement until late in the second trimester.) The women gave nuanced, compelling reasons for wanting to end their pregnancies.\nAfterward, nearly all said that termination had been the right decision. At five years, only 14 percent felt any sadness about having an abortion; two in three ended up having no or very few emotions about it at all. “Relief” was the most common feeling, and an abiding one.\nFrom the May 2022 issue: The future of abortion in a post-Roe America\nThe policy impact of the Turnaway research has been significant, even though it was published during a period when states have been restricting abortion access. In 2018, the Iowa Supreme Court struck down a law requiring a 72-hour waiting period between when a person seeks and has an abortion, noting that “the vast majority of abortion patients do not regret the procedure, even years later, and instead feel relief and acceptance”—a Turnaway finding. That same finding was cited by members of Chile’s constitutional court as they allowed for the decriminalization of abortion in certain circumstances.\nYet the research has not swayed many people who advocate for abortion bans, believing that life begins at conception and that the law must prioritize the needs of the fetus. Other activists have argued that Turnaway is methodologically flawed; some women approached in the clinic waiting room declined to participate, and not all participating women completed all interviews. “The women who anticipate and experience the most negative reactions to abortion are the least likely to want to participate in interviews,” the activist David Reardon argued in a 2018 article in a Catholic Medical Association journal.\nStill, four dozen papers analyzing the Turnaway Study’s findings have been published in peer-reviewed journals; the research is “the gold standard,” Emily M. Johnston, an Urban Institute health-policy expert who wasn’t involved with the project, told me. In the trajectories of women who received an abortion and those who were denied one, “we can understand the impact of abortion on women’s lives,” Foster told me. “They don’t have to represent all women seeking abortion for the findings to be valid.” And her work has been buttressed by other surveys, showing that women fear the repercussions of unplanned pregnancies for good reason and do not tend to regret having a termination. “Among the women we spoke with, they did not regret either choice,” whether that was having an abortion or carrying to term, Johnston told me. “These women were thinking about their desires for themselves, but also were thinking very thoughtfully about what kind of life they could provide for a child.”\nThe Turnaway study, for Foster, underscored that nobody needs the government to decide whether they need an abortion. If and when America’s highest court overturns Roe, though, an estimated 34 million women of reproductive age will lose some or all access to the procedure in the state where they live. Some people will travel to an out-of-state clinic to terminate a pregnancy; some will get pills by mail to manage their abortions at home; some will “try and do things that are less safe,” as Foster put it. Many will carry to term: The Guttmacher Institute has estimated that there will be roughly 100,000 fewer legal abortions per year post-Roe. “The question now is who is able to circumvent the law, what that costs, and who suffers from these bans,” Foster told me. “The burden of this will be disproportionately put on people who are least able to support a pregnancy and to support a child.”\nEllen Gruber Garvey: I helped women get abortions in pre-Roe America\nFoster said that there is a lot we still do not know about how the end of Roe might alter the course of people’s lives—the topic of her new research. “In the Turnaway Study, people were too late to get an abortion, but they didn’t have to feel like the police were going to knock on their door,” she told me. “Now, if you’re able to find an abortion somewhere and you have a complication, do you get health care? Do you seek health care out if you’re having a miscarriage, or are you too scared? If you’re going to travel across state lines, can you tell your mother or your boss what you’re doing?”\nIn addition, she said that she was uncertain about the role that abortion funds—local, on-the-ground organizations that help people find, travel to, and pay for terminations—might play. “We really don’t know who is calling these hotlines,” she said. “When people call, what support do they need? What is enough, and who falls through the cracks?” She added that many people are unaware that such services exist, and might have trouble accessing them.\nPeople are resourceful when seeking a termination and resilient when denied an abortion, Foster told me. But looking into the post-Roe future, she predicted, “There’s going to be some widespread and scary consequences just from the fact that we’ve made this common health-care practice against the law.” Foster, to her dismay, is about to have a lot more research to do.

The name is based on fact that in a room with 23 people or more, the odds are greater than 50% that two will share the same birthday. Many find this counterintuitive, and the birthday paradox illustrates why many people’s instinct on probability (and risk) is wrong. You are not trying to match a specific birthday (such as yours); you are trying to match any birthday.\nIf you are in a room full of 23 people, you have a 1 in 365 chance of sharing a birthday with each of the 22 other people in the room, for a total of 22/365 chances. If you fail to match, you leave the room and Joe has a 21/365 chance of sharing a birthday with the remaining people. If Joe fails to match, he leaves the room and Morgan has a 20/365 chance, and so on. If you add 22/365 + 21/365 + 20/365 + 19/365 … + 1/365, you pass 50% probability.\nThe birthday attack is used to create hash collisions. Just as matching your birthday is difficult, finding a specific input with a hash that collides with another input is difficult. However, just like matching any birthday is easier, finding any input that creates a colliding hash with any other input is easier due to the birthday attack.\nComptTIA Security+ ",

        "title": "Conditions of Causation",
        "tags": [],
        "content": "Conditions of Causality There are four conditions of causality: logical time ordering, correlation, mechanism, and nonspuriousness. Logical time ordering refers to the idea that one variable needs to precede another variable in time for the first variable to influence the second variable. For example, throughout the world, people are protesting their governments. In some countries, governments respond with the metaphorical yawn. However, in other countries, the governments may respond with repressive tactics. The question is do the protest precede the government response? On its face, the answer is yes because why would the government respond to silence?\nThe second condition of causality is correlation. As we explored above, correlation is a connection between two variables. Correlation is a prerequisite to establishing a causal relationship because if two variables do not move together, then it is difficult to suggest that one influences the other. Maintaining our example of public protest and government response, we often see that when people protest, the government pays attention. This is due to mainstream media coverage and social media activity of the protest. Since governments typically have responsibility for maintaining peace and security, anytime there are activities that may disrupt peace, the government will likely pay attention to what the media is covering and decide whether to respond.\nOur third condition of causality is mechanism. A causal mechanism is an explanation for how one variable influences the other. Explanations can vary from relatively straightforward to exhaustively complex. There is utility in employing both types of explanations to describe the influence of one variable on the next variable. The reason is it may be straightforward to some while the government responds to protesters. However, underlying this interaction, there may be other actors, decisions, and actions that may shape engagement between the government and protesters. For example, the Arab Spring starting in 2010 provides a contemporary example where people throughout countries in the Middle East publicly protested for changes in their political leadership and government systems. How did these protesters come together? Some researchers point to social media, like Facebook and Twitter, which helped people collectively organize their protesting efforts. Thus, we have a mechanism that shows how protest formed, and how that initiated reaction from governments.\nThe final condition of causality is non-spuriousness. Non-spuriousness means that another variable is not having an influence. With our example of protest and government response, we must be careful to consider that other factors may influence this relationship. What else could influence a government\u0026rsquo;s response to a protest within its country? A government may be hesitant to respond with lethal force if it knows it\u0026rsquo;s being observed by an international media. An international media outlet serves as a third-party observer to the activities within a country. As the media records through video and first-hand accounts, they can begin to share that information with the rest of the world. A government that uses lethal weapons on people who are peacefully protesting could result in an outcry from the international community. Thus, are protests the only thing that is influencing the government\u0026rsquo;s response? Or is there a spurious factor, such as the international media outlet, that having the government question how it should respond?\nAs you can see, from a running example of public protest and government action, establishing a causal relationship between two variables is difficult. The difficulty doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean we don\u0026rsquo;t work through these four conditions, both using reason and evidence, rather it represents a rigorous way to determine a causal relationship.\nfrom libretexts\n",

        "content": "DNS Zone Transfers DNS zone transfers using the AXFR protocol are the simplest mechanism to replicate DNS records across DNS servers. To avoid the need to edit information on multiple DNS servers, you can edit information on one server and use AXFR to copy information to other servers. However, if you do not protect your servers, malicious parties may use AXFR to get information about all your hosts.\nHow DNS Works DNS (Domain Name System) is like an Internet phonebook. It is responsible for resolving human-readable hostnames into machine-readable IP addresses. The system includes authoritative DNS servers that provide information and DNS caches that store that information temporarily for client lookups. A typical DNS query is very simple: a client provides a human-readable hostname and in response receives an IP address. However, the system assumes that the querying client knows the hostname.\nDNS servers host zones. A DNS zone is a portion of the domain name space that is served by a DNS server. For example, example.com with all its subdomains may be a zone. However, second.example.com may also be a separate zone.\nWhy DNS Zone Transfer is Needed DNS is a critical service. If a DNS server for a zone is not working and cached information has expired, the domain is inaccessible to all services (web, mail, and more). Therefore, each zone should have at least two DNS servers. For more critical zones, there may be even more.\nHowever, a zone may be large and may require frequent changes. If you manually edit zone data on each server separately, it takes a lot of time and there is a a lot of potential for a mistake. This is why DNS zone transfer is needed.\nYou can use different mechanisms for DNS zone transfer but the simplest one is AXFR (technically speaking, AXFR refers to the protocol used during a DNS zone transfer). It is a client-initiated request. Therefore, you can edit information on the primary DNS server and then use AXFR from the secondary DNS server to download the entire zone.\nHow to Initiate a DNS Zone Transfer Initiating an AXFR zone-transfer request from a secondary server is as simple as using the following dig commands, where zonetransfer.me is the domain that we want to initiate a zone transfer for. First, we need to get the list of DNS servers for the domain:\ndig +short ns zonetransfer.me Now, we can initiate an AXFR request to get a copy of the zone from the primary server:\ndig axfr zonetransfer.me @nsztm1.digi.ninja ; \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; DiG 9.16.24 \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; axfr zonetransfer.me @nsztm1.digi.ninja ;; global options: +cmd zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tSOA\tnsztm1.digi.ninja. robin.digi.ninja. 2019100801 172800 900 1209600 3600 zonetransfer.me.\t300\tIN\tHINFO\t\u0026#34;Casio fx-700G\u0026#34; \u0026#34;Windows XP\u0026#34; zonetransfer.me.\t301\tIN\tTXT\t\u0026#34;google-site-verification=tyP28J7JAUHA9fw2sHXMgcCC0I6XBmmoVi04VlMewxA\u0026#34; zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tMX\t0 ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM. zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tMX\t10 ALT1.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM. zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tMX\t10 ALT2.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM. zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tMX\t20 ASPMX2.GOOGLEMAIL.COM. zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tMX\t20 ASPMX3.GOOGLEMAIL.COM. zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tMX\t20 ASPMX4.GOOGLEMAIL.COM. zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tMX\t20 ASPMX5.GOOGLEMAIL.COM. zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tA\t5.196.105.14 zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tNS\tnsztm1.digi.ninja. zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tNS\tnsztm2.digi.ninja. _acme-challenge.zonetransfer.me. 301 IN\tTXT\t\u0026#34;6Oa05hbUJ9xSsvYy7pApQvwCUSSGgxvrbdizjePEsZI\u0026#34; _sip._tcp.zonetransfer.me. 14000 IN\tSRV\t0 0 5060 www.zonetransfer.me. 14.105.196.5.IN-ADDR.ARPA.zonetransfer.me. 7200\tIN PTR www.zonetransfer.me. asfdbauthdns.zonetransfer.me. 7900 IN\tAFSDB\t1 asfdbbox.zonetransfer.me. asfdbbox.zonetransfer.me. 7200\tIN\tA\t127.0.0.1 asfdbvolume.zonetransfer.me. 7800 IN\tAFSDB\t1 asfdbbox.zonetransfer.me. canberra-office.zonetransfer.me. 7200 IN A\t202.14.81.230 cmdexec.zonetransfer.me. 300\tIN\tTXT\t\u0026#34;; ls\u0026#34; contact.zonetransfer.me. 2592000 IN\tTXT\t\u0026#34;Remember to call or email Pippa on +44 123 4567890 or pippa@zonetransfer.me when making DNS changes\u0026#34; dc-office.zonetransfer.me. 7200\tIN\tA\t143.228.181.132 deadbeef.zonetransfer.me. 7201\tIN\tAAAA\tdead:beaf:: dr.zonetransfer.me.\t300\tIN\tLOC\t53 20 56.558 N 1 38 33.526 W 0.00m 1m 10000m 10m DZC.zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tTXT\t\u0026#34;AbCdEfG\u0026#34; email.zonetransfer.me.\t2222\tIN\tNAPTR\t1 1 \u0026#34;P\u0026#34; \u0026#34;E2U+email\u0026#34; \u0026#34;\u0026#34; email.zonetransfer.me.zonetransfer.me. email.zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tA\t74.125.206.26 Hello.zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tTXT\t\u0026#34;Hi to Josh and all his class\u0026#34; home.zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tA\t127.0.0.1 Info.zonetransfer.me.\t7200\tIN\tTXT\t\u0026#34;ZoneTransfer.me service provided by Robin Wood - robin@digi.ninja.

When diffraction is involved, one moves from the eikonal approximation (back) to Maxwell\u0026rsquo;s Equations.\nOptics and Quantum Mechanics Optics is described by Maxwell\u0026rsquo;s equations, which can be written as a wave equation with dispersion relation \\(\\omega = ck\\)\n",

        "title": "Fileless Malware",
        "tags": ["endpointProtection","antivirus","malware",],
        "content": "What is Fileless Malware? Traditionally, antivirus and other endpoint security products have focused on files (executables) to detect and prevent malware. There are several advantages to this. Files can be hashed, queried in reputation services, examined by both static analysis and machine learning, and easily excluded for false detections.\nThis is a problem for hackers: if the malware’s signature is detected two days after release, the attacker’s ROI (return on investment) may be significantly less than expected, or even negligible.\nFileless malware is malicious code that does not require using an executable file on the endpoint’s file system besides those that are already there. It is typically injected into some running process and executes only in RAM. This makes it far more difficult for traditional antivirus software and other endpoint security products to detect or prevent because of the low footprint and the absence of files to scan. These often utilize system processes available and trusted by the OS. Examples include:\nVBScript JScript PowerShell Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Batch files Mshta and rundll32 (or other Windows signed files capable of running malicious code) Malware hidden within documents is also considered fileless. Although such data files are not allowed to run code, there are vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office and PDF readers that adversaries can exploit to obtain code execution. For example, an infected document could trigger a malicious PowerShell command. There are also a few built-in functionalities that allow code execution within documents, like macros and DDE attack.\nHow Does Fileless Malware work? The most common form of fileless malware in the wild is when a victim clicks on a spam link within an email or fraudulent website. That link or website then loads the Flash application and implements a relevant exploit in order to infect the user’s machine. Afterward, the malware uses shellcode in order to run a command that allows it to both download and execute the payload solely within memory.\nCharacteristics This type of malicious software makes use of programs that are already on the computer. Its behavior can’t be detected by heuristics scanners and it has no identifiable code or signature.\nAdditionally, fileless malware resides within the memory of the system.\nIn order to function, it takes advantage of the processes of the infected operating system. More advanced fileless malware can also be combined with other types of malware to facilitate complex cyberattacks. It can even circumvent both whitelisting and sandboxing under the right circumstances.\nStages of a Fileless Malware Attack Such attacks function in a fairly unique way:\nMalware gains access to the machine oftentimes with a phishing email or social engineering tactic, or perhaps compromised credentials\nThe program establishes persistance implementing a backdoor\ndata exfiltration Common Fileless Malware Techniques Memory resident malware By using the memory space of a real Windows file, attackers can load malicious code that lies dormant until activated. The fileless aspect is that the malware can’t be detected by standard file-scanning antivirus software.\nRootkits Because rootkits exist on the kernel rather than in a file, they have powerful abilities to avoid detection. They are 100% fileless, but fit into this category as it evolves.\nWindows Registry Malware Like in the example mentioned above, these attacks takes advantage of the Windows Registry database that stores low-level settings for various applications. The malware relies on code executed through a file, but this file is set to self-destruct after execution, allowing the malware to persist as fileless.\nFalse credentials As the name suggests, this type of attack involves using compromised credentials from a legitimate user (aka – stolen username and password). After the hacker has gained access to the system, they then implement shellcode in order to facilitate their attack on the machine.\nIn extreme cases, they may even place code within the registry in order to establish ongoing access to the computer.\nFileless ransomware For those who are unfamiliar with this type of malware, ransomware is a malicious program that hackers use in order to extort money from their victims. They often encrypt sensitive data and threaten to delete it unless a certain amount of money is paid, often via cryptocurrency.\nWhen this type of fileless attack occurs, hackers are able to carry out the attack without ever writing to the disk of the machine. This makes it difficult to discern until it’s too late.\nExploit kits Threat actors use a collection of tools known as exploit kits in order to take advantage of vulnerabilities on a victim’s computer. These attacks generally begin as a typical fileless malware attack would, meaning they often convince the user to click on a fraudulent link.\nOnce the program is able to infiltrate the machine, the exploit kit can scan the system to determine vulnerabilities to take advantage of and then come up with a specific set of exploits to deploy. Oftentimes, the malware will go undetected and gain extensive access to the system and data.\nThe problem One of the reasons fileless malware is so compelling is that security products cannot just block the system files or software that are utilized in these kinds of attack. For example, PowerShell: More importantly, from a defensive point of view, blocking it would be futile: There are many public sources explaining how to bypass the PowerShell execution policy, and other ways to use it that bypass the PowerShell.exe block. To name a few:\nRun PowerShell with dlls only, with a simple rundll32 command using PowerShdll Convert PowerShell scripts into other EXE files, with tools like PS2EXE Use malware that utilizes its own copy of PowerShell.exe or modifies the local PowerShell to avoid recognition of PowerShell by security products Embed a PowerShell script in the pixels of a PNG file and generate a one-liner to execute it using Invoke-PSImage Blocking MS Office Macros In an attempt to eliminate this attack vector, Microsoft added an option to disable macros as a site setting (starting in Office 2016). However, most environments still allow them, so security vendors have mainly tackled this in two ways:\nBlock macros across the board – this enforces the same restrictions being offered by Microsoft for organizations that can do without macros Extract the macro code for static analysis or reputation checks – this can work in some cases. However, the shortcoming of this approach is that such code is extremely difficult to classify and detect within a tolerable false positive rate, especially for never-seen-before malicious macros. In addition, very few repositories of benign and malicious code exist. Another option is looking for common functions typically found in attacks, but again these are variable and not widely-catalogued Server-Side Detection Some products use agent-side monitoring only and make the decision on the server or in the cloud. This approach has the same disadvantages as any detection that does not happen on the endpoint. Mainly, in order to work, it requires connectivity and prevention is impossible because the agent has to wait for the server to respond before acting.\nDetection Behavior, not identity The key is to look at the behavior of processes executing on the endpoint rather than inspecting the files on the machine. This is effective because, despite the large and increasing number of malware variants, they operate in very similar ways. The number of malware behaviors is considerably smaller than the number of ways a malicious file might look, making this approach suitable for prevention and detection.\nAlthough SentinelOne uses multiple engines, including static and behavioral AI, the behavioral approach is extremely good at detecting and preventing this type of attack because it is agnostic regarding the attack vector.\nThe effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated in examples like the WannaCry campaign, where SentinelOne was able to defend customers before the ransomware had been seen in the wild.\n",

        "content": "Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) Wiki Overview ISAKMP defines the procedures for authenticating a communicating peer, creation and management of Security Associations, key generation techniques and threat mitigation (e.g. denial of service and replay attacks). As a framework,[1] ISAKMP typically utilizes IKE for key exchange, although other methods have been implemented such as Kerberized Internet Negotiation of Keys. A Preliminary SA is formed using this protocol; later a fresh keying is done.\nISAKMP defines procedures and packet formats to establish, negotiate, modify and delete Security Associations. SAs contain all the information required for execution of various network security services, such as the IP layer services (such as header authentication and payload encapsulation), transport or application layer services or self-protection of negotiation traffic. ISAKMP defines payloads for exchanging key generation and authentication data. These formats provide a consistent framework for transferring key and authentication data which is independent of the key generation technique, encryption algorithm and authentication mechanism.\nISAKMP is distinct from key exchange protocols in order to cleanly separate the details of security association management (and key management) from the details of key exchange. There may be many different key exchange protocols, each with different security properties. However, a common framework is required for agreeing to the format of SA attributes and for negotiating, modifying and deleting SAs. ISAKMP serves as this common framework.\nISAKMP can be implemented over any transport protocol. All implementations must include send and receive capability for ISAKMP using UDP on port 500.\nFrom ComptTIA Security+ Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP), an element of Internet Key Exchange (IKE), is used to organize and manage the encryption keys that have been generated and exchanged by Oakley and SKEME. A security association is the agreed-on method of authentication and encryption used by two entities (a bit like a digital keyring). ISAKMPs use of security associations is what enables IPSec to support multiple simultaneous VPNs from each host. Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) provides confidentiality and integrity of packet contents. ESP provides encryption, limited authentication, and prevents replay attacks. Secure Key Exchange MEchanism (SKEME), an element of Internet Key Exchange (IKE), is a means to ex-change keys securely. Authentication Header (AH) provides assurances of message integrity and nonrepudiation. AH also provides authentication, access control, and prevents replay attacks.\n",

The GOT is important for techniques such as the ret-to-libc attack Stack Canaries = tokens placed after a stack to detect a stack overflow. Stack canaries sit beside the stack in memory (where the program variables are stored), and if there is a stack overflow, then the canary will be corrupted. This allows the program to detect a buffer overflow and shut down. NX = NX is short for non-executable. If this is enabled, then memory segments can be either writable or executable, but not both. This stops potential attackers from injecting their own malicious code (called shellcode) into the program, because something in a writable segment cannot be executed. On the vulnerable binary, you may have noticed the extra line RWX that indicates that there are segments which can be read, written, and executed. wiki PIE = PIE stands for Position Independent Executable. This loads the program dependencies into random locations, so attacks that rely on memory layout are more difficult to conduct. redhat Resource for properties involved in checksec : siphos\nCyclic If we look at the files and permissions in the cyclic directory:\nYou will see that the flag file and intro2pwn3 are owned by the same user, and that the suid bit is set for intro2pwn3. This means that the program will keep its permissions when it executes.\nTaking a look at the c code:\n1 cat cyclic/test_cyclic.c #include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;stdlib.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;unistd.h\u0026gt; void print_flag() { printf(\u0026#34;Getting Flag:\\n\u0026#34;); fflush(stdout); char *cat_flag[3] = {\u0026#34;/bin/cat\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;flag.txt\u0026#34;, NULL}; execve(\u0026#34;/bin/cat\u0026#34;, cat_flag, NULL); exit(0); } void start(){ char name[24]; gets(name); } int main(){ printf(\u0026#34;I run as dizmas.\\n\u0026#34;); printf(\u0026#34;Who are you?: \u0026#34;); start(); } We see that although we (buzz) can run this program, the print_flag() function isn\u0026rsquo;t executed. This program is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, because it uses the gets() function, which does not check to see if the user input is actually in bounds. In our case, the name variable has 24 bytes allocated, so if we input more than 24 bytes, we can write to other parts of memory. An important part of the memory we can overwrite is the instruction pointer (IP), which is called the eip on 32-bit machines, and rip on 64-bit machines. The IP points to the next instruction to be executed, so if we redirect the eip in our binary to the print_flag() function, we can print the flag.\nCyclic To control the IP, the first thing we need do is to is overflow the stack with a pattern, so we can see where the IP is.

        "tags": ["Stoicism","Nietzsche",],
        "content": "Nietzsche and Stoicism Resolution of contradictions After describing the Stoics’ essential psychological characteristics, Nietzsche advances two obscure but critical remarks. First, he questions whether the Stoics’ attainment of their ethical ideal is significant on the grounds that the decision to adopt Stoic therapy is determined in advance by one’s character. Second, he rebukes the Stoics for underestimating the worth of pain and passion, and for the fatalistic acceptance of life that their therapy produces. Confusingly, however, Nietzsche elsewhere celebrates characteristics for which Stoicism is well known; for instance, self-sufficiency and its associated characteristics, such as hardness, independence, and self-mastery. Moreover, the Stoic’s fatalistic declaration, ‘I want nothing different!’, seems to express precisely the love of fate, or amor fati, that Nietzsche himself embraces.\nThe Stoics view nature as rationally ordered and teleological. Their world is pervaded by a ubiquitous casual order, called fate, which governs everything in accord with reason (Gould 1974, esp. 17–18; Long and Sedley 1987, 331, 340–343). Specifically human flourishing, or virtue, consists in perfecting humanity’s uniquely rational nature (Epictetus 6; Marcus VII.55). This requires assenting only to impressions in accordance with nature’s rational order, desiring only what is appropriate to this order, and acting only on rational desires. If achieved, such rational self-discipline allows joyful acceptance of fate (Epictetus 8; Marcus VIII.26). James A. Mollison (2019) Nietzsche contra stoicism: naturalism and value, suffering and amor fati, Inquiry, 62:1, 93-115, DOI: 10.1080/0020174X.2019.1527547\n",

This has not been our historic practice. Over thirty years ago, Munzer and Nickel (1977, 1029) wrote that “one does not have to dig very deeply into the literature of American constitutional law to suspect that many constitutional provisions do not mean today what their framers thought they meant.” Yet originalism still has great appeal.

When you run commands, see the output on your screen, those are objects.\nSkeleton of a class called student:\nclass student { } Classes have properties that look like parameters that are attributes that describe that class. The example below shows a class called student with two properties; FirstName and LastName.\nWhen you define a property, you should always define a type that sets a specific schema for what property values can hold. In the example below, both properties are defined as strings.\nStudent Class Class with two properties:\nclass student { [string]$FirstName [string]$LastName } After you define a class, create an object from it or instantiate an object. There are multiple ways to instantiate objects from classes; one common way is to use type accelerators such as [student] which represent the class, followed by a default method that comes with every class called new().\nUsing the type accelerator shortcut is the same as creating an object using the New-Object command.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve created an object from that class, then assign values to properties. The example below is assigning values of Tyler and Muir for the FirstName and LastName properties.\nclass student { [string]$FirstName [string]$LastName } $student1 = [student]::new() $student1.FirstName = \u0026#39;Tyler\u0026#39; $student1.LastName = \u0026#39;Muir\u0026#39; $student1 | Get-Member $student1 | Write-Output Notice that Get-Member returns four methods and two properties. The properties probably look familiar, but the methods sure don\u0026rsquo;t. PowerShell adds certain methods by default, but you can add your own methods or even modify the default methods.\nMethods Defining methods with a scriptblock\n[\u0026lt;output type\u0026gt;]\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;() { \u0026lt;code that runs when the method is executed\u0026gt; } Method parameters set set inside the parentheses ().\nreturn is mandatory PowerShell functions will return objects by simply placing the object anywhere in the function; if a method returns an object, you must use the return construct as shown below.\n[string]GetName() { return \u0026#39;foo\u0026#39; } References Taken from: ATA\n",

Then pass that set of parameters to the command with @\u0026lt;hashtablename\u0026gt;\n$Params = @{ \u0026#34;Path\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;Testfile.txt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;Destination\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;CopiedFile.txt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;WhatIf\u0026#34; = $true \u0026#34;force\u0026#34; = $true \u0026#34;Recurse\u0026#34; = $true } Copy-Item @Params $Params = @{ \u0026#34;Path\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;TestFile.txt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;Destination\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;CopiedFile.txt\u0026#34; } Copy-Item @Params -Force -WhatIf In Powershell 7.1, you can override splatted parameters:\n$Params = @{ \u0026#34;Path\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;TestFile.txt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;Destination\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;CopiedFile.txt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;WhatIf\u0026#34; = $True \u0026#34;Force\u0026#34; = $True } Copy-Item @Params -WhatIf:$False For positional parameters, splat an array:\n$ParamArray = @( \u0026#34;TestFile.txt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;CopiedFile.txt\u0026#34; ) Copy-Item @ParamArray Proxy Functions and Splatted Commands : these functions allow you to add additional parameters to the original cmdlet and then call that cmdlet with the new parameters. When you run a function in PowerShell, PowerShell creates an automatic array variable called $Args. This array contains all unnamed parameter values passed to that function.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll find another automatic variable called $PSBoundParameters which contains a hashtable of all bound parameters. Notice below the Test-Function function that returns the $Param1 and $Param2 parameters.\nFunction Test-Function { Param( $Param1, $Param2 ) Write-Host \u0026#34;Unnamed Parameters\u0026#34; -ForegroundColor \u0026#39;Green\u0026#39; $Args Write-Host \u0026#34;Bound Parameters\u0026#34; -ForegroundColor \u0026#39;Green\u0026#39; $PSBoundParameters } Test-Function \u0026#34;test1\u0026#34; \u0026#34;test2\u0026#34; \u0026#34;test3\u0026#34; -Param1 \u0026#34;testParam\u0026#34; -Param2 \u0026#34;testParam2\u0026#34; Unnamed Parameters test1 test2 test3 Bound Parameters Key Value --- ----- Param1 testParam Param2 testParam2 Building a Wrapper Function using Splatted Parameters* To show how useful splatting can be in wrapper functions, create a custom function that passes unnamed parameters and named parameters to the Copy-Item cmdlet. With this technique, you can quickly create custom functions that add additional functionality but retain the same parameter set you would expect.\nFunction Copy-CustomItem { Get-ChildItem Copy-Item @Args @PSBoundParameters Get-ChildItem } Copy-CustomItem \u0026#34;TestFile.txt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;CopiedFile.txt\u0026#34; -force -verbose ",

For thirty years we have made a virtue out of the pursuit of material self-interest: indeed, this very pursuit now constitutes whatever remains of our sense of collective purpose. We know what things cost but have no idea what they are worth. We no longer ask of a judicial ruling or a legislative act: is it good? Is it fair? Is it just? Is it right? Will it help bring about a better society or a better world? These used to be the political questions, even if they invited no easy answers. We must learn once again to pose them.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why do we experience such difficulty even imagining a different sort of society? Why is it beyond us to conceive of a different set of arrangements to our common advantage? Are we doomed indefinitely to lurch between a dysfunctional \u0026lsquo;free market\u0026rsquo; and the much-advertised horrors of \u0026lsquo;socialism\u0026rsquo;?\nOur disability is discursive: we simply do not know how to talk about these things any more. For the last thirty years, when asking ourselves whether we support a policy, a proposal or an initiative, we have restricted ourselves to issues of profit and loss\u0026ndash;economic questions in the narrowest sense. But this is not an instinctive condition: it is an acquired taste.\u0026rdquo;\nIll Fares the Land - Tony Judt Quote 4 \u0026ldquo;To see what is in front of one\u0026rsquo;s nose needs a constant struggle.\u0026rdquo;\nGeorge Orwell ",

        "content": "Education spending and student learning outcomes DAVID EVANS|JANUARY 17, 2019 World Bank Blog Prior findings World Bank\u0026rsquo;s World Development Report 2004 showed little correlation between spending and access to school World Development Report 2018 shows a similarly weak correlation between spending and learning outcomes Vegas and Coffin, using a different econometric specification, do find a correlation between spending and learning outcomes up to US$8,000 per student annually. Does money matter? Yes. [section copied from source]\nHistorically, most primary and secondary education was financed by local property taxes, so richer areas had better funded schools. But between 1971 and 2010, more than two dozen states had to reduce inequality in spending due to judicial decisions. This led to changes in school spending that were not related to other variables like local commitment to education that normally make it hard to parse out the link between financing and education. Using the variation in spending coming from the first wave of reforms, \u0026ldquo;a 10% increase in per pupil spending each year for all 12 years of public school leads to 0.31 more completed years of education, about 7% higher wages, and a 3.2 percentage-point reduction in the annual incidence of adult poverty. They also find that the effects are more pronounced for children from low-income families\u0026rdquo;.\nA study of more recent school finance reforms finds that \u0026ldquo;a one-time $1,000 increase in per-pupil annual spending sustained for 10 years increased test scores by between 0.12 and 0.24 standard deviations\u0026rdquo;. Another study finds that in states with strong teacher unions, school districts tended to match increases in state funding, which \u0026ldquo;led to larger increases in student achievement\u0026rdquo;. Other work looks at the impact of these financing reforms on high school graduation rates: \u0026ldquo;Seven years after reform, the highest poverty quartile in a treated state experienced an 11.5 percent to 12.1 percent increase in per-pupil spending, and a 6.8 to 11.5 percentage point increase in graduation rates\u0026rdquo;.\nBeyond school finance reforms, the Great Recession (2007 to 2009 in the United States) provides an additional natural experiment. State tax revenues fell much more suddenly than local or national revenues, so states that relied more on state revenues had a disproportionate drop in financing. Researchers found that \u0026ldquo;a 10 percent school spending cut reduced test scores by about 7.8 percent of a standard deviation\u0026rdquo;. Another study finds comparable results: \u0026ldquo;a 10 percent increase in spending improves\u0026hellip;student test scores by 0.05 to 0.09 standard deviations.\u0026rdquo;\nIn sum, out of 13 multi-state studies, Jackson finds that 12 show a positive, statistically significant relationship between education spending and student outcomes. And remember: these aren\u0026rsquo;t just correlations. These are all studies that have tried to tease out the actual impact of spending on learning or attainment.\nSee Jackson\u0026rsquo;s review for discussion around dependency on how money is spent.\nThe Relationship Between School Funding and Student Outcomes aei : Adam Tyner , 8 Oct 2019 Visible Learning \u0026ndash; Hattie Visible Learning\nFurther References C Kirabo Jackson American Economic Journal Finance reforms Learning Policy Institute \u0026ndash; report Countries outperforming Us beatty\n",

        "content": "An analysis of the coherence \u0026ndash; or lack thereof \u0026ndash; of Trump\u0026rsquo;s policies and politics , along with general remarks on what he did while in office.\nChanges in American Policy Many Americans will remember President Donald Trump\u0026rsquo;s presidency as a four-yearlong storm of tweets, rallies and on-air rants that ended in a mob riot and historic second impeachment. But there was more to the Trump presidency than attention-hogging political drama and conflict; often unnoticed, Trump and his administration actually did succeed in changing some of the ways Washington works.\nObamacare \u0026ndash; accidentally bolstered Trump came into office vowing to repeal Obamacare and even took the law to court when that failed in Congress. But his most significant imprint on the Affordable Care Act was an accidental boost that happened when he stumbled into pouring billions of extra federal dollars into subsidizing Americans\u0026rsquo; coverage.\nHouse Republicans had tried for years to cut off subsidies that helped low-income Obamacare enrollees with the co-pays, co-insurance and deductibles that come with their health plans. In 2017, Trump finally did it through administrative means after the GOP effort to replace the law fell apart, and he immediately drew intense outcry from Democrats and policy experts who called the move sabotage.\nThe health exchanges didn\u0026rsquo;t collapse, as Trump had hoped. Instead, health plans and states quickly figured out a way to claw back the federal dollars they lost: they built the costs of the subsidies into premiums for Obamacare\u0026rsquo;s benchmark \u0026ldquo;silver\u0026rdquo; policies. This meant that premiums for these \u0026ldquo;silver\u0026rdquo; plans spiked and as a result, the premium subsidies the government had to pay for low-income enrollees vastly increased. The concept, known as \u0026ldquo;silver-loading,\u0026rdquo; (Brookings , Bloomberg) grew government subsidizing of the exchanges by upwards of $20 billion per year.\nWhile Trump\u0026rsquo;s moves made Obamacare plans increasingly unaffordable for the unsubsidized, Democrats quickly tamped down their criticisms since it accomplished their goal of significantly boosting funding for Obamacare. The incoming Biden administration isn\u0026rsquo;t likely to reverse course.\nStrategy \u0026ndash; refocused national security on great power competition Trump administration\u0026rsquo;s National Defense Strategy stands out as one of the most important defense policy shifts of the last generation, reorienting the American military to confront rising and increasingly aggressive powers Russia and China.\nThe move: The 2018 strategy rewired the Defense Department\u0026rsquo;s vast bureaucracy away from a focus on fighting insurgents and terrorists in the Middle East toward a long-term strategic competition with China and Russia. As a result, the military is changing how it trains personnel, which technologies it buys, and the geographic areas of the world where it prioritizes its forces.\nThe impact: Already it has led to a reordering of the Pentagon budget and new investments supported by a bipartisan majority in Congress, including billions of dollars to beef up the U.S. military presence in the Asia-Pacific.\nThe upshot: Despite differences in tone and rhetoric, this is a refocusing of the United States\u0026rsquo; military posture that is expected to continue in the Biden administration.\nCoronavirus \u0026ndash; no workplace guidance Arguably the most consequential decision Trump made involving American workers was something it chose not to do: It declined to implement a so-called \u0026rsquo;emergency temporary standard\u0026rsquo; when the coronavirus pandemic hit. Such a standard, issued when the Occupational Safety and Health Administration determines workers are in \u0026lsquo;grave danger,\u0026rsquo; would have established immediate and mandatory workplace safety rules employers must follow to protect employees from exposure.\nThe move: Despite pressure from Democrats, unions and worker advocates, OSHA refused to set rules for worker safety during the pandemic. Republicans defended the decision by saying the burden on companies struggling to stay afloat amid the recession would be too great. In the absence of a standard, employers have only had to comply with a mix of optional guidelines, able to pick and choose what precautions they take.\nThe impact: The agency\u0026rsquo;s backseat approach to workplace safety means Americans still face a dangerously unpredictable range of safety conditions when they show up to work. Though OSHA has cited some companies for coronavirus-related transgressions, many large corporations received meager fines even in cases where workers died from Covid-19. Democrats have attempted to include language mandating an emergency temporary standard in future rounds of pandemic aid, but their efforts have been unsuccessful.\nThe upshot: One of the first things a Biden administration will likely move to do is instruct OSHA to step up worker safety enforcement, including by enacting an emergency standard and ramping up penalties on violators. Biden\u0026rsquo;s campaign also pledged to double the number of OSHA investigators to enforce the law and existing standards.\nReferences From: Politico\n",

        "content": "Wildcare Certificates digicert\nWhat is a SSL Wildcard Certificate?\nA SSL/TLS Wildcard certificate is a single certificate with a wildcard character (*) in the domain name field. This allows the certificate to secure multiple sub domain names (hosts) pertaining to the same base domain.\nFor example, a wildcard certificate for *.(domainname).com, could be used for www.(domainname).com, mail.(domainname).com, store.(domainname).com, in addition to any additional sub domain name in the (domainname).com.\nWhen a client checks the sub domain name in this type of certificate, it uses a shell expansion procedure to see if it matches.\nWhat is the difference between a SAN certificate and a Wildcard certificate? A Subject Alternative Name (SAN) certificate is capable of supporting multiple domains and multiple host names with domains. SANS certificates are more flexible than Wildcard certificates since they are not limited to a single domain.\nCombining the functionality of both allows you secure a much broader set of domains along with the capability to use them on any number of sub-domains.\nNote: Only non-Wildcard names can be added as SAN.\nWhen should I request a SSL Wildcard Certificate?\nA SSL/TLS Wildcard certificate should be considered an option when looking to secure a number of sub domains, such as \u0026lsquo;secure.(domainname).com\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;www.(domainname).com\u0026rsquo;, and \u0026lsquo;mail.(domainname).com\u0026rsquo; with a single certificate.\nThe format of the common name entered for the SSL/TLS Wildcard Certificate will be \u0026lsquo;*.(domainname).com\u0026rsquo;.\nHow do I add SAN? SAN is an optional feature available during your Wildcard SSL/TLS purchase, you can add up to an additional 250 SANs to a single certificate.\nNote: It is imperative that software documentation is referenced to ensure that the server on which the certificate will be installed on supports wildcard certificates.\nDo SSL/TLS Wildcard Certificates work with all servers and browsers?\nSSL/TLS Wildcard certificates work with most servers. If unsure, check with your server vendor for further assistance.\nCan I share the IP address with all the sub domain names?\nYes. As the same certificate will be used to secure all the sub domain names associated with a domain name, an IP address can be shared amongst all of the sub domain names. SSL/TLS by nature of the protocol is IP based but in this case, where the same certificate will be used by all sub domain names, a Wildcard certificate can be configured for use with name-based virtual hosts instead of IP -based virtual hosts.\nUpdating licensing is not applicable.\nTLS/SSL Wildcard Certificates: Multiple Servers\nA TLS/SSL Wildcard certificate secures all the sub domain names associated with a domain name on one server. If multiple servers are involved, the certificate and it\u0026rsquo;s corresponding private key would need to be used on the other servers.\nPlease Note: The use of one certificate on more than one device can result in increased security risks to networks and that DigiCert expressly disclaims any liability for breaches of security that result from the distribution of a single private key across multiple devices.\n",
