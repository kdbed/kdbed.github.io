# XOR

## Basics

Exclusive or – 'XOR' – is a Boolean binary operator that is true when either the first input or the second input, but not both, are true.

XOR is a 'programmable inverter': one input bit decides whether to invert the other input bit or to just pass it through unchanged. 'Inverting' bits is also called 'flipping' bits.

$X = A \bigoplus B$
