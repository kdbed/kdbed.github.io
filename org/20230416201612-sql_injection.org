** SQLi - websocket

[[https://rayhan0x01.github.io/ctf/2021/04/02/blind-sqli-over-websocket-automation.html][rayhan0x01 blind sql injection via websocket]]

From the above post

"If you didn't know, the main difference between HTTP and WebSocket is that HTTP is built on a request-response model whereas WebSocket is like a Socket connection where both client and server can send data anytime asynchronously. So you can't repeat the requests made in WebSocket as you would normally do for HTTP Requests in BurpSuite."
