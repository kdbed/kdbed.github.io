* Skeleton Key
A **Skeleton Key** is a stealthy backdoor attack where Mimikatz injects a patch into **LSASS memory** on a Domain Controller. This allows an attacker to **authenticate as any domain user using a master password**, in addition to their real credentials.

** Overview
- Injects code into `lsass.exe` on a Domain Controller
- Leaves legitimate logins untouched
- Adds a universal password valid for all domain accounts
- Memory-resident: disappears on reboot

** Prerequisites
- SYSTEM-level access on a **Domain Controller**
- Ability to execute code and patch LSASS memory
- Mimikatz or similar tool

** Key Concepts
- *LSASS*: Local Security Authority Subsystem Service; handles authentication
- *Patch*: Modifies Kerberos/NTLM authentication providers in memory
- *Backdoor password*: An additional universal password accepted for all users

** Mimikatz Commands

*** Load Skeleton Key Patch
#+begin_src powershell
mimikatz # privilege::debug
mimikatz # misc::skeleton
#+end_src

Default password: mimikatz


Once injected, *any* domain user can authenticate with either:
- Their real password
- The skeleton key password: `mimikatz`

*** Test Authentication
From any domain-joined machine:
#+begin_src powershell
runas /user:corp.local\jdoe cmd
# Enter password: mimikatz
#+end_src

A shell should open, authenticating as `jdoe`.

** Limitations
- Only works with **NTLM** and **Kerberos TGTs issued by the patched DC**
- Only works while the DC is running (cleared on reboot)
- Does not persist unless reloaded or installed via persistent malware

** Impact
- Full domain compromise
- Extremely stealthy â€“ no password changes, no account creation
- Invisible to domain logs unless memory or behavior is being monitored

** Detection
- Monitor LSASS for code injection or unsigned module loads
- Behavioral indicators:
  - Unusual NTLM/Kerberos logons without known credentials
  - Multiple users authenticating with the same password
- Defender for Identity, EDRs like CrowdStrike, Sysmon for `lsass.exe` memory anomalies

** Mitigation
- Reboot the DC (clears the patch)
- Use Protected Process Light (PPL) for LSASS (Windows Defender Credential Guard)
- Monitor with EDR
- Block admin rights to DCs and restrict RDP access
- Isolate and rebuild compromised DCs
