* Kerbrute
 - based on obtaining a TGT. For example, using kinit on a Linux system, we can obtain and cache a Kerberos TGT. We'll need to provide a username and password to do this. If the credentials are valid, we'll obtain a TGT. The advantage of this technique is that it only uses two UDP frames to determine whether the password is valid, as it sends only an AS-REQ and examines the response.
