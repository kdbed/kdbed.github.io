* Kerbrute
- Kerbrute is a popular enumeration tool used to brute-force and enumerate valid active-directory users by abusing the Kerberos pre-authentication.
- based on obtaining a TGT. For example, using kinit on a Linux system, we can obtain and cache a Kerberos TGT. We'll need to provide a username and password to do this. If the credentials are valid, we'll obtain a TGT. The advantage of this technique is that it only uses two UDP frames to determine whether the password is valid, as it sends only an AS-REQ and examines the response. By brute-forcing Kerberos pre-authentication, you do not trigger the account failed to log on event which can throw up red flags to blue teams.
** Kerberos Pre-Authentication Behavior
Kerberos authentication starts with an AS-REQ (Authentication Service Request) sent to the Key Distribution Center (KDC), which is typically the domain controller.

When a valid username is submitted:

The KDC responds with an error indicating that pre-authentication is required (error code: KRB5KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_REQUIRED / 0x19).

When an invalid username is submitted:

The KDC responds with an error indicating that the principal (user) is unknown (error code: KRB5KDC_ERR_C_PRINCIPAL_UNKNOWN / 0x6).
