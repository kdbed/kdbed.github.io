* The difference between hashing and encryption
The difference betwen hashing and encryption determines how likely an exposed password can be abused after a breach. Hashing is such that it can't be directly reversed (hash --> plaintext), but the plaintext can be guessed by hashing a large number of candidates and comparing the results. Password hashing is one-way and deterministic. This means that sites that store hashes never actually keep the password, but re-hashing at logon provides a reliable point of comparison.
