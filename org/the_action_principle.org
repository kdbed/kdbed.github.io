* The Action Principle
Define the Lagrangian as the following combination of the kinetic energy $T$ and the potential energy $V$:

$$
L = T - V
$$

$L$ is a function of the coordinates $x$ and the velocity $\dot{x}$, which are treated as independent variables.
For a point particle

$$
L(x,\dot{x}) = \frac{1}{2}m \sum_{i=1}^D (\dot{x}^i)^2 - V(x)
$$

Taking derivatives

\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial L}{\partial x^i} &= - \frac{\partial V}{\partial x^i} \\
\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}^i} &= m \dot{x}^i
\end{align*}

Using Newton's equations, it follows that

$$
\boxed{0 = \frac{\partial L}{\partial x^i} - \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}^i}\right)}
$$

These are the Euler-Lagrange equations.
